<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Sam Stubener ran through his mail carelessly and
rapidly. As became a manager of prize-fighters, he was accustomed to a
various and bizarre correspondence. Every crank, sport, near sport, and
reformer seemed to have ideas to impart to him. From dire threats
against his life to milder threats, such as pushing in the front of his
face, from rabbit-foot fetishes to lucky horse-shoes, from dinky
jerkwater bids to the quarter-of-a-million-dollar offers of
irresponsible nobodies, he knew the whole run of the surprise portion
of his mail. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>In his time having received a razor-strop made from
the skin of a lynched negro, and a finger, withered and sun-dried, cut
from the body of a white man found in Death Valley, he was of the
opinion that never again would the postman bring him anything that
could startle him. But this morning he opened a letter that he read a
second time, put away in his pocket, and took out for a third reading.
It was postmarked from some unheard-of post-office in Siskiyou County,
and it ran:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">Dear Sam:</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know me, except my reputation. You come after my
time, and I&rsquo;ve been out of the game a long time. But take it from
me I ain&rsquo;t been asleep. I&rsquo;ve followed the whole game, and
I&rsquo;ve followed you, from the time Kal Aufman knocked you out to
your last handling of Nat Belson, and I take it you&rsquo;re the
niftiest thing in the line of managers that ever came down the pike.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>I got a proposition for you. I got the greatest unknown that ever
happened. This ain&rsquo;t con. It&rsquo;s the straight goods. What do
you think of a husky that tips the scales at two hundred and twenty
pounds fighting weight, is twenty-two years old, and can hit a kick
twice as hard as my best ever? That&rsquo;s him, my boy, Young Pat
Glendon, that&rsquo;s the name he&rsquo;ll fight under. I&rsquo;ve
planned it all out. Now the best thing you can do is hit the first
train and come up here.</p>
<p>I bred him and I trained him. All that I ever had in my head
I&rsquo;ve hammered into his. And maybe you won&rsquo;t believe it, but
he&rsquo;s added to it. He&rsquo;s a born fighter. He&rsquo;s a wonder
at time and distance. He just knows to the second and the inch, and he
don&rsquo;t have to think about it at all. His six-inch jolt is more
the real sleep medicine than the full-arm swing of most geezers.</p>
<p>Talk about the hope of the white race. This is him. Come and take a
peep. When you was managing Jeffries you was crazy about hunting. Come
along and I&rsquo;ll give you some real hunting and fishing that will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>make your moving picture winnings look like thirty
cents. I&rsquo;ll send Young Pat out with you. I ain&rsquo;t able to
get around. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sending for you. I was going to
manage him myself. But it ain&rsquo;t no use. I&rsquo;m all in and
likely to pass out any time. So get a move on. I want you to manage
him. There&rsquo;s a fortune in it for both of you, but I want to draw
up the contract.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>PAT GLENDON.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stubener was puzzled. It seemed, on the face of it, a joke&mdash;the
men in the fighting game were notorious jokers&mdash;and he tried to
discern the fine hand of Corbett or the big friendly paw of Fitzsimmons
in the screed before him. But if it were genuine, he knew it was worth
looking into. Pat Glendon was before his time, though, as a cub, he had
once seen Old Pat spar at the benefit for Jack Dempsey. Even then he
was called <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>&ldquo;Old&rdquo; Pat, and had been out of the ring
for years. He had antedated Sullivan, in the old London Prize Ring
Rules, though his last fading battles had been put up under the
incoming Marquis of Queensbury Rules.</p>
<p>What ring-follower did not know of Pat Glendon?&mdash;though few
were alive who had seen him in his prime, and there were not many more
who had seen him at all. Yet his name had come down in the history of
the ring, and no sporting writer&rsquo;s lexicon was complete without
it. His fame was paradoxical. No man was honored higher, and yet he had
never attained championship honors. He had been unfortunate, and had
been known as the unlucky fighter.</p>
<p>Four times he all but won the heavyweight championship, and each
time he had deserved to win it. There was the time on the barge, in San
Francisco Bay, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>when, at the moment he had the champion going, he
snapped his own forearm; and on the island in the Thames, sloshing
about in six inches of rising tide, he broke a leg at a similar stage
in a winning fight; in Texas, too, there was the never-to-be-forgotten
day when the police broke in just as he had his man going in all
certainty. And finally, there was the fight in the Mechanics&rsquo;
Pavilion in San Francisco, when he was secretly jobbed from the first
by a gun-fighting bad man of a referee backed by a small syndicate of
bettors. Pat Glendon had had no accidents in that fight, but when he
had knocked his man cold with a right to the jaw and a left to the
solar plexus, the referee calmly disqualified him for fouling. Every
ringside witness, every sporting expert, and the whole sporting world,
knew there had been no foul. Yet, like all fighters, Pat Glendon had
agreed to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>abide by the decision of the referee. Pat abided,
and accepted it as in keeping with the rest of his bad luck.</p>
<p>This was Pat Glendon. What bothered Stubener was whether or not Pat
had written the letter. He carried it down town with him. What&rsquo;s
become of Pat Glendon? Such was his greeting to all sports that
morning. Nobody seemed to know. Some thought he must be dead, but none
knew positively. The fight editor of a morning daily looked up the
records and was able to state that his death had not been noted. It was
from Tim Donovan, that he got a clue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure an&rsquo; he ain&rsquo;t dead,&rdquo; said Donovan.
&ldquo;How could that be?&mdash;a man of his make that never boozed or
blew himself? He made money, and what&rsquo;s more, he saved it and
invested it. Didn&rsquo;t he have three saloons at the one time?
An&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t he makin&rsquo; slathers of money with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>them when he sold out? Now that I&rsquo;m
thinkin&rsquo;, that was the last time I laid eyes on him&mdash;when he
sold them out. &rsquo;Twas all of twenty years and more ago. His wife
had just died. I met him headin&rsquo; for the Ferry. &lsquo;Where
away, old sport?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s me for the
woods,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve quit. Good-by, Tim, me
boy.&rsquo; And I&rsquo;ve never seen him from that day to this. Of
course he ain&rsquo;t dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say when his wife died&mdash;did he have any
children?&rdquo; Stubener queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, a little baby. He was luggin&rsquo; it in his arms that
very day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I be knowin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then that Sam Stubener reached a decision, and that night
found him in a Pullman speeding toward the wilds of Northern
California. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Stubener was dropped off the overland at Deer Lick in
the early morning, and he kicked his heels for an hour before the one
saloon opened its doors. No, the saloonkeeper didn&rsquo;t know
anything about Pat Glendon, had never heard of him, and if he was in
that part of the country he must be out beyond somewhere. Neither had
the one hanger-on ever heard of Pat Glendon. At the hotel the same
ignorance obtained, and it was not until the storekeeper and postmaster
opened up that Stubener struck the trail. Oh, yes, Pat Glendon lived
out beyond. You took the stage at Alpine, which was forty miles and
which was a logging camp. From Alpine, on <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>horseback, you rode up
Antelope Valley and crossed the divide to Bear Creek. Pat Glendon lived
somewhere beyond that. The people of Alpine would know. Yes, there was
a young Pat. The storekeeper had seen him. He had been in to Deer Lick
two years back. Old Pat had not put in an appearance for five years. He
bought his supplies at the store, and always paid by check, and he was
a white-haired, strange old man. That was all the storekeeper knew, but
the folks at Alpine could give him final directions.</p>
<p>It looked good to Stubener. Beyond doubt there was a young Pat
Glendon, as well as an old one, living out beyond. That night the
manager spent at the logging camp of Alpine, and early the following
morning he rode a mountain cayuse up Antelope Valley. He rode over the
divide and down Bear Creek. He rode all day, through the wildest,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>roughest country he had ever seen, and at sunset
turned up Pinto Valley on a trail so stiff and narrow that more than
once he elected to get off and walk.</p>
<p>It was eleven o&rsquo;clock when he dismounted before a log cabin
and was greeted by the baying of two huge deer-hounds. Then Pat Glendon
opened the door, fell on his neck, and took him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew ye&rsquo;d come, Sam, me boy,&rdquo; said Pat, the
while he limped about, building a fire, boiling coffee, and frying a
big bear-steak. &ldquo;The young un ain&rsquo;t home the night. We was
gettin&rsquo; short of meat, and he went out about sundown to pick up a
deer. But I&rsquo;ll say no more. Wait till ye see him. He&rsquo;ll be
home in the morn, and then you can try him out. There&rsquo;s the
gloves. But wait till ye see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for me, I&rsquo;m finished. Eighty-one come next January,
an&rsquo; pretty good for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href=
"#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>an ex-bruiser. But I never wasted
meself, Sam, nor kept late hours an&rsquo; burned the candle at all
ends. I had a damned good candle, an&rsquo; made the most of it, as
you&rsquo;ll grant at lookin&rsquo; at me. And I&rsquo;ve taught the
same to the young un. What do you think of a lad of twenty-two
that&rsquo;s never had a drink in his life nor tasted tobacco?
That&rsquo;s him. He&rsquo;s a giant, and he&rsquo;s lived natural all
his days. Wait till he takes you out after deer. He&rsquo;ll break your
heart travelin&rsquo; light, him a carryin&rsquo; the outfit and a big
buck deer belike. He&rsquo;s a child of the open air, an&rsquo; winter
nor summer has he slept under a roof. The open for him, as I taught
him. The one thing that worries me is how he&rsquo;ll take to
sleepin&rsquo; in houses, an&rsquo; how he&rsquo;ll stand the tobacco
smoke in the ring. &lsquo;Tis a terrible thing, that smoke, when
you&rsquo;re fighting hard an&rsquo; gaspin&rsquo; for air. But no
more, Sam, me boy. You&rsquo;re <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>tired an&rsquo; sure should be
sleepin&rsquo;. Wait till you see him, that&rsquo;s all. Wait till you
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the garrulousness of age was on old Pat, and it was long before
he permitted Stubener&rsquo;s eyes to close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can run a deer down with his own legs, that young
un,&rdquo; he broke out again. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the dandy
trainin&rsquo; for the lungs, the hunter&rsquo;s life. He don&rsquo;t
know much of else, though, he&rsquo;s read a few books at times
an&rsquo; poetry stuff. He&rsquo;s just plain pure natural, as
you&rsquo;ll see when you clap eyes on him. He&rsquo;s got the old
Irish strong in him. Sometimes, the way he moons about, it&rsquo;s
thinkin&rsquo; strong I am that he believes in the fairies and
such-like. He&rsquo;s a nature lover if ever there was one, an&rsquo;
he&rsquo;s afeard of cities. He&rsquo;s read about them, but the
biggest he was ever in was Deer Lick. He misliked the many people, and
his report was that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>they&rsquo;d stand weedin&rsquo; out. That
was two years agone&mdash;the first and the last time he&rsquo;s seen a
locomotive and a train of cars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s wrong I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; I am,
bringin&rsquo; him up a natural. It&rsquo;s given him wind and stamina
and the strength o&rsquo; wild bulls. No city-grown man can have a
look-in against him. I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo; to grant that Jeffries at
his best could &rsquo;a&rsquo; worried the young un a bit, but only a
bit. The young un could &rsquo;a&rsquo; broke him like a straw.
An&rsquo; he don&rsquo;t look it. That&rsquo;s the everlasting wonder
of it. He&rsquo;s only a fine-seeming young husky; but it&rsquo;s the
quality of his muscle that&rsquo;s different. But wait till ye see him,
that&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange liking the boy has for posies, an&rsquo; little
meadows, a bit of pine with the moon beyond, windy sunsets, or the sun
o&rsquo; morns from the top of old Baldy. An&rsquo; he has a
hankerin&rsquo; for the drawin&rsquo; o&rsquo; pitchers of things,
an&rsquo; of spouting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17"
name="pb17">17</a>]</span>about &lsquo;Lucifer or night&rsquo; from the
poetry books he got from the red-headed school teacher. But &rsquo;tis
only his youngness. He&rsquo;ll settle down to the game once we get him
started, but watch out for grouches when it first comes to livin&rsquo;
in a city for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good thing; he&rsquo;s woman-shy. They&rsquo;ll not bother
him for years. He can&rsquo;t bring himself to understand the
creatures, an&rsquo; damn few of them has he seen at that. &rsquo;Twas
the school teacher over at Samson&rsquo;s Flat that put the poetry
stuff in his head. She was clean daffy over the young un, an&rsquo; he
never a-knowin&rsquo;. A warm-haired girl she was&mdash;not a mountain
girl, but from down in the flat-lands&mdash;an&rsquo; as time went by
she was fair desperate, an&rsquo; the way she went after him was
shameless. An&rsquo; what d&rsquo;ye think the boy did when he tumbled
to it? He was scared as a jackrabbit. He took blankets <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>an&rsquo; ammunition an&rsquo; hiked for tall
timber. Not for a month did I lay eyes on him, an&rsquo; then he
sneaked in after dark and was gone in the morn. Nor would he as much as
peep at her letters. &lsquo;Burn &rsquo;em,&rsquo; he said. An&rsquo;
burn &rsquo;em I did. Twice she rode over on a cayuse all the way from
Samson&rsquo;s Flat, an&rsquo; I was sorry for the young creature. She
was fair hungry for the boy, and she looked it in her face. An&rsquo;
at the end of three months she gave up school an&rsquo; went back to
her own country, an&rsquo; then it was that the boy came home to the
shack to live again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women ha&rsquo; ben the ruination of many a good fighter, but
they won&rsquo;t be of him. He blushes like a girl if anything young in
skirts looks at him a second time or too long the first one. An&rsquo;
they all look at him. But when he fights, when he fights!&mdash;God!
it&rsquo;s the old savage Irish that flares in him, an&rsquo; drives
the fists of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>him. Not that he goes off his base. Don&rsquo;t
walk away with that. At my best I was never as cool as he. I misdoubt
&rsquo;twas the wrath of me that brought the accidents. But he&rsquo;s
an iceberg. He&rsquo;s hot an&rsquo; cold at the one time, a live wire
in an ice-chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stubener was dozing, when the old man&rsquo;s mumble aroused him. He
listened drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a man o&rsquo; him, by God! I made a man o&rsquo; him,
with the two fists of him, an&rsquo; the upstanding legs of him,
an&rsquo; the straight-seein&rsquo; eyes. And I know the game in my
head, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve kept up with the times and the modern
changes. The crouch? Sure, he knows all the styles an&rsquo; economies.
He never moves two inches when an inch and a half will do the turn. And
when he wants he can spring like a buck kangaroo. In-fightin&rsquo;?
Wait till you see. Better than his out-fightin&rsquo;, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>and he
could sure &rsquo;a&rsquo; sparred with Peter Jackson an&rsquo;
outfooted Corbett in his best. I tell you, I&rsquo;ve taught&rsquo;m it
all, to the last trick, and he&rsquo;s improved on the teachin&rsquo;.
He&rsquo;s a fair genius at the game. An&rsquo; he&rsquo;s had plenty
of husky mountain men to try out on. I gave him the fancy work and they
gave him the sloggin&rsquo;. Nothing shy or delicate about them.
Roarin&rsquo; bulls an&rsquo; big grizzly bears, that&rsquo;s what they
are, when it comes to huggin&rsquo; in a clinch or swingin&rsquo;
rough-like in the rushes. An&rsquo; he plays with &rsquo;em. Man,
d&rsquo;ye hear me?&mdash;he plays with them, like you an&rsquo; me
would play with little puppy-dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another time Stubener awoke, to hear the old man mumbling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the funny think he don&rsquo;t take fightin&rsquo;
seriously. It&rsquo;s that easy to him he thinks it play. But wait till
he&rsquo;s tapped a swift one. That&rsquo;s all, wait. An&rsquo;
you&rsquo;ll see&rsquo;m throw on the juice in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>that
cold storage plant of his an&rsquo; turn loose the prettiest scientific
wallopin&rsquo; that ever you laid eyes on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the shivery gray of mountain dawn, Stubener was routed from his
blankets by old Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; up the trail now,&rdquo; was the
hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Out with ye an&rsquo; take your first peep at
the biggest fightin&rsquo; man the ring has ever seen, or will ever see
in a thousand years again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager peered through the open door, rubbing the sleep from his
heavy eyes, and saw a young giant walk into the clearing. In one hand
was a rifle, across his shoulders a heavy deer under which he moved as
if it were weightless. He was dressed roughly in blue overalls and
woolen shirt open at the throat. Coat he had none, and on his feet,
instead of brogans, were moccasins. Stubener noted that his walk was
smooth and catlike, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span>without suggestion of his two hundred and
twenty pounds of weight to which that of the deer was added. The fight
manager was impressed from the first glimpse. Formidable the young
fellow certainly was, but the manager sensed the strangeness and
unusualness of him. He was a new type, something different from the run
of fighters. He seemed a creature of the wild, more a night-roaming
figure from some old fairy story or folk tale than a twentieth-century
youth.</p>
<p>A thing Stubener quickly discovered was that young Pat was not much
of a talker. He acknowledged old Pat&rsquo;s introduction with a grip
of the hand but without speech, and silently set to work at building
the fire and getting breakfast. To his father&rsquo;s direct questions
he answered in monosyllables, as, for instance, when asked where he had
picked up the deer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;South Fork,&rdquo; was all he vouchsafed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven miles across the mountains,&rdquo; the old man
exposited pridefully to Stubener, &ldquo;an&rsquo; a trail that&rsquo;d
break your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breakfast consisted of black coffee, sourdough bread, and an immense
quantity of bear-meat broiled over the coals. Of this the young fellow
ate ravenously, and Stubener divined that both the Glendons were
accustomed to an almost straight meat diet. Old Pat did all the
talking, though it was not till the meal was ended that he broached the
subject he had at heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat, boy,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;you know who the gentleman
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Pat nodded, and cast a quick, comprehensive glance at the
manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll be takin&rsquo; you away with him and down
to San Francisco.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href=
"#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner stay here, dad,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>Stubener felt a prick of disappointment. It was a wild goose chase
after all. This was no fighter, eager and fretting to be at it. His
huge brawn counted for nothing. It was nothing new. It was the big
fellows that usually had the streak of fat.</p>
<p>But old Pat&rsquo;s Celtic wrath flared up, and his voice was harsh
with command<span class="corr" id="xd26e316" title=
"Not in source">.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go down to the cities an&rsquo; fight, me boy.
That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve trained you for, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; was the unexpected response, rumbled
apathetically from the deep chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And fight like hell,&rdquo; the old man added.</p>
<p>Again Stubener felt disappointment at the absence of flash and fire
in the young man&rsquo;s eyes as he answered: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. When do we start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sam, here, he&rsquo;ll be wantin&rsquo; a little
huntin&rsquo; and to fish a bit, as well as to try you out with the
gloves.&rdquo; He looked at Sam, who nodded. &ldquo;Suppose you strip
and give&rsquo;m a taste of your quality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later, Sam Stubener had his eyes opened. An ex-fighter
himself, a heavyweight at that, he was even a better judge of fighters,
and never had he seen one strip to like advantage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See the softness of him,&rdquo; old Pat chanted.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the true stuff. Look at the slope of the shoulders,
an&rsquo; the lungs of him. Clean, all clean, to the last drop
an&rsquo; ounce of him. You&rsquo;re lookin&rsquo; at a man, Sam, the
like of which was never seen before. Not a muscle of him bound. No
weight-lifter or Sandow exercise artist there. See the fat snakes of
muscles a-crawlin&rsquo; soft an&rsquo; lazy-like. Wait till
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>you see them flashin&rsquo; like a strikin&rsquo;
rattler. He&rsquo;s good for forty rounds this blessed instant, or a
hundred. Go to it! Time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went to it, for three-minute rounds with a minute rests, and
Sam Stubener was immediately undeceived. Here was no streak of fat, no
apathy, only a lazy, good-natured play of gloves and tricks, with a
brusk stiffness and harsh sharpness in the contacts that he knew
belonged only to the trained and instinctive fighting man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy, now, easy,&rdquo; old Pat warned. &ldquo;Sam&rsquo;s
not the man he used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This nettled Sam, as it was intended to do, and he played his most
famous trick and favorite punch&mdash;a feint for a clinch and a right
rip to the stomach. But, quickly as it was delivered, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e345" title="Source: Young">young</span> Pat saw it,
and, though it landed, his body was going away. The next time, his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>body did not go away. As the rip started, he moved
forward and twisted his left hip to meet it. It was only a matter of
several inches, yet it blocked the blow. And thereafter, try as he
would, Stubener&rsquo;s glove got no farther than that hip.</p>
<p>Stubener had roughed it with big men in his time, and, in exhibition
bouts, had creditably held his own. But there was no holding his own
here. Young Pat played with him, and in the clinches made him feel as
powerful as a baby, landing on him seemingly at will, locking and
blocking with masterful accuracy, and scarcely noticing or
acknowledging his existence. Half the time young Pat seemed to spend in
gazing off and out at the landscape in a dreamy sort of way. And right
here Stubener made another mistake. He took it for a trick of old
Pat&rsquo;s training, tried to sneak in a short-arm jolt, found
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>his arm in a lightning lock, and had both his ears
cuffed for his pains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The instinct for a blow,&rdquo; the old man chortled.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not put on, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you. He is a wiz.
He knows a blow without the lookin&rsquo;, when it starts an&rsquo;
where, the speed, an&rsquo; space, an&rsquo; niceness of it. An&rsquo;
&rsquo;tis nothing I ever showed him. &rsquo;Tis inspiration. He was so
born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, in a clinch, the fight manager heeled his glove on young
Pat&rsquo;s mouth, and there was just a hint of viciousness in the
manner of doing it. A moment later, in the next clinch, Sam received
the heel of the other&rsquo;s glove on his own mouth. There was nothing
snappy about it, but the pressure, stolidly lazy as it was, put his
head back till the joints cracked and for the moment he thought his
neck was broken. He slacked his body and dropped his arms in token that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>the bout was over, felt the instant release, and
staggered clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll&mdash;he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he gasped, looking
the admiration he lacked the breath to utter.</p>
<p>Old Pat&rsquo;s eyes were brightly moist with pride and triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what will you be thinkin&rsquo; to happen when some
of the gay an&rsquo; ugly ones tries to rough it on him?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll kill them, sure,&rdquo; was Stubener&rsquo;s
verdict.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s too cool for that. But he&rsquo;ll just hurt
them some for their dirtiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s draw up the contract,&rdquo; said the
manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till you know the whole worth of him!&rdquo; Old Pat
answered. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis strong terms I&rsquo;ll be makin&rsquo; you
come to. Go for a deer-hunt with the boy over the hills an&rsquo; learn
the lungs and the legs of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href=
"#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>him. Then we&rsquo;ll sign up
iron-clad and regular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stubener was gone two days on that hunt, and he learned all and more
than old Pat had promised, and came back a very weary and very humble
man. The young fellow&rsquo;s innocence of the world had been startling
to the case-hardened manager, but he had found him nobody&rsquo;s fool.
Virgin though his mind was, untouched by all save a narrow mountain
experience, nevertheless he had proved possession of a natural keenness
and shrewdness far beyond the average. In a way he was a mystery to
Sam, who could not understand his terrible equanimity of temper.
Nothing ruffled him or worried him, and his patience was of an enduring
primitiveness. He never swore, not even the futile and emasculated
cuss-words of sissy-boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d swear all right if I wanted to,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>he had
explained, when challenged by his companion. &ldquo;But I guess
I&rsquo;ve never come to needing it. When I do, I&rsquo;ll swear, I
suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Pat, resolutely adhering to his decision, said good-by at the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be long, Pat, boy, when I&rsquo;ll be
readin&rsquo; about you in the papers. I&rsquo;d like to go along, but
I&rsquo;m afeard it&rsquo;s me for the mountains till the
end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, drawing the manager aside, the old man turned loose on him
almost savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember what I&rsquo;ve ben tellin&rsquo; ye over an&rsquo;
over. The boy&rsquo;s clean an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s honest. He knows
nothing of the rottenness of the game. I kept it all away from him, I
tell you. He don&rsquo;t know the meanin&rsquo; of fake. He knows only
the bravery, an&rsquo; romance an&rsquo; glory of fightin&rsquo;, and
I&rsquo;ve filled him up with tales of the old ring heroes, though
little enough, God <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32"
name="pb32">32</a>]</span>knows, it&rsquo;s set him afire. Man, man,
I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you that I clipped the fight columns from the
newspapers to keep it &rsquo;way from him&mdash;him a-thinkin&rsquo; I
was wantin&rsquo; them for me scrap book. He don&rsquo;t know a man
ever lay down or threw a fight. So don&rsquo;t you get him in anything
that ain&rsquo;t straight. Don&rsquo;t turn the boy&rsquo;s stomach.
That&rsquo;s why I put in the null and void clause. The first
rottenness and the contract&rsquo;s broke of itself. No snide division
of stake-money; no secret arrangements with the movin&rsquo; pitcher
men for guaranteed distance. There&rsquo;s slathers o&rsquo; money for
the both of you. But play it square or you lose. Understand?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And whatever you&rsquo;ll be doin&rsquo; watch out for the
women,&rdquo; was old Pat&rsquo;s parting admonishment, young Pat
astride his horse and reining in dutifully to hear. &ldquo;Women is
death an&rsquo; damnation, remember that. But when you do find the one,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>the only one, hang on to her. She&rsquo;ll be
worth more than glory an&rsquo; money. But first be sure, an&rsquo;
when you&rsquo;re sure, don&rsquo;t let her slip through your fingers.
Grab her with the two hands of you and hang on. Hang on if all the
world goes to smash an&rsquo; smithereens. Pat, boy, a good woman is
&hellip; a good woman. &rsquo;Tis the first word and the last.&rdquo;

<p class="first">Once in San Francisco, Sam Stubener&rsquo;s troubles
began. Not that young Pat had a nasty temper, or was grouchy as his
father had feared. On the contrary, he was phenomenally sweet and mild.
But he was homesick for his beloved mountains. Also, he was secretly
appalled by the city, though he trod its roaring streets imperturbable
as a red Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came down here to fight,&rdquo; he announced, at the end of
the first week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Jim Hanford?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stubener whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A big champion like him wouldn&rsquo;t look at you,&rdquo;
was his answer. &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Go and get a reputation,&rsquo; is
what he&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can lick him.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;But the public doesn&rsquo;t know that. If you licked him
you&rsquo;d be champion of the world, and no champion ever became so
with his first fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the public doesn&rsquo;t know it, Pat. It wouldn&rsquo;t
come to see you fight. And it&rsquo;s the crowd that brings the money
and the big purses. That&rsquo;s why Jim Hanford wouldn&rsquo;t
consider you for a second. There&rsquo;d be nothing in it for him.
Besides, he&rsquo;s getting three thousand a week right now in
vaudeville, with a contract for twenty-five weeks. Do you think
he&rsquo;d chuck that for a go with a man no one ever heard of?
You&rsquo;ve got to do something first, make a record. You&rsquo;ve got
to begin on the little local dubs that nobody ever heard of&mdash;guys
like Chub Collins, Rough-House Kelly, and the Flying Dutchman. When
you&rsquo;ve put them away, you&rsquo;re only started on the first
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>round of the ladder. But after that you&rsquo;ll
go up like a balloon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet those three named in the same ring one after
the other,&rdquo; was Pat&rsquo;s decision. &ldquo;Make the
arrangements accordingly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stubener laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong? Don&rsquo;t you think I can put them
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you can,&rdquo; Stubener assured him. &ldquo;But it
can&rsquo;t be arranged that way. You&rsquo;ve got to take them one at
a time. Besides, remember, I know the game and I&rsquo;m managing you.
This proposition has to be worked up, and I&rsquo;m the boy that knows
how. If we&rsquo;re lucky, you may get to the top in a couple of years
and be the champion with a mint of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat sighed at the prospect, then brightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that I can retire and go back home to the old
man,&rdquo; he said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37"
name="pb37">37</a>]</span></p>
<p>Stubener was about to reply, but checked himself. Strange as was
this championship material, he felt confident that when the top was
reached it would prove very similar to that of all the others who had
gone before. Besides, two years was a long way off, and there was much
to be done in the meantime.</p>
<p>When Pat fell to moping around his quarters, reading endless poetry
books and novels drawn from the public library, Stubener sent him off
to live on a Contra Costa ranch across the Bay, under the watchful eye
of Spider Walsh. At the end of a week Spider whispered that the job was
a cinch. His charge was away and over the hills from dawn till dark,
whipping the streams for trout, shooting quail and rabbits, and
pursuing the one lone and crafty buck famous for having survived a
decade of hunters. It was the Spider who waxed lazy and fat, while
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>his charge kept himself in condition.</p>
<p>As Stubener expected, his unknown was laughed at by the fight club
managers. Were not the woods full of unknowns who were always breaking
out with championship rashes? A preliminary, say of four
rounds&mdash;yes, they would grant him that. But the main
event&mdash;never. Stubener was resolved that young Pat should make his
debut in nothing less than a main event, and, by the prestige of his
own name he at last managed it. With much misgiving, the Mission Club
agreed that Pat Glendon could go fifteen rounds with Rough-House Kelly
for a purse of one hundred dollars. It was the custom of young fighters
to assume the names of old ring heroes, so no one suspected that he was
the son of the great Pat Glendon, while Stubener held his peace. It was
a good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>press surprise package to spring later.</p>
<p>Came the night of the fight, after a month of waiting.
Stubener&rsquo;s anxiety was keen. His professional reputation was
staked that his man would make a showing, and he was astounded to see
Pat, seated in his corner a bare five minutes, lose the healthy color
from his cheeks, which turned a sickly yellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, boy,&rdquo; Stubener said, slapping him on the
shoulder. &ldquo;The first time in the ring is always strange, and
Kelly has a way of letting his opponent wait for him on the chance of
getting stage-fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; Pat answered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
the tobacco smoke. I&rsquo;m not used to it, and it&rsquo;s making me
fair sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manager experienced the quick shock of relief. A man who turned
sick from mental causes, even if he were a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>Samson,
could never win to place in the prize ring. As for tobacco smoke, the
youngster would have to get used to it, that was all.</p>
<p>Young Pat&rsquo;s entrance into the ring had been met with silence,
but when Rough-House Kelly crawled through the ropes his greeting was
uproarious. He did not belie his name. He was a ferocious-looking man,
black and hairy, with huge, knotty muscles, weighing a full two hundred
pounds. Pat looked across at him curiously, and received a savage
scowl. After both had been introduced to the audience, they shook
hands. And even as their gloves gripped, Kelly ground his teeth,
convulsed his face with an expression of rage, and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got yer nerve wid yeh.&rdquo; He flung
Pat&rsquo;s hand roughly from his, and hissed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll eat
yeh up, ye pup!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The audience laughed at the action, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>and it guessed
hilariously at what Kelly must have said.</p>
<p>Back in his corner, and waiting the gong, Pat turned to
Stubener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is he angry with me?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Stubener answered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
his way, trying to scare you. It&rsquo;s just
mouth-fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t boxing,&rdquo; was Pat&rsquo;s comment; and
Stubener, with a quick glance, noted that his eyes were as mildly blue
as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; the manager warned, as the gong for the
first round sounded and Pat stood up. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s liable to come
at you like a man-eater.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And like a man-eater Kelly did come at him, rushing across the ring
in wild fury. Pat, who in his easy way had advanced only a couple of
paces, gauged the other&rsquo;s momentum, side-stepped, and brought his
stiff-arched right across to the jaw. Then he stood and looked on with
a great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>curiosity. The fight was over. Kelly had fallen
like a stricken bullock to the floor, and there he lay without movement
while the referee, bending over him, shouted the ten seconds in his
unheeding ear. When Kelly&rsquo;s seconds came to lift him, Pat was
before them. Gathering the huge, inert bulk of the man in his arms, he
carried him to his corner and deposited him on the stool and in the
arms of his seconds.</p>
<p>Half a minute later, Kelly&rsquo;s head lifted and his eyes wavered
open. He looked about him stupidly and then to one of his seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he queried hoarsely. &ldquo;Did the
roof fall on me?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href=
"#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As a result of his fight with Kelly, though the
general opinion was that he had won by a fluke, Pat was matched with
Rufe Mason. This took place three weeks later, and the Sierra Club
audience at Dreamland Rink failed to see what happened. Rufe Mason was
a heavyweight, noted locally for his cleverness. When the gong for the
first round sounded, both men met in the center of the ring. Neither
rushed. Nor did they strike a blow. They felt around each other, their
arms bent, their gloves so close together that they almost touched.
This lasted for perhaps five seconds. Then it happened, and so quickly
that not one in a hundred of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44"
href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>audience saw. Rufe Mason made a
feint with his right. It was obviously not a real feint, but a feeler,
a mere tentative threatening of a possible blow. It was at this instant
that Pat loosed his punch. So close together were they that the
distance the blow traveled was a scant eight inches. It was a short-arm
left jolt, and it was accomplished by a twist of the left forearm and a
thrust of the shoulder. It landed flush on the point of the chin and
the astounded audience saw Rufe Mason&rsquo;s legs crumple under him as
his body sank to the floor. But the referee had seen, and he promptly
proceeded to count him out. Again Pat carried his opponent to his
corner, and it was ten minutes before Rufe Mason, supported by his
seconds, with sagging knees and rolling, glassy eyes, was able to move
down the aisle through the stupefied and incredulous audience on the
way to his dressing room. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href=
"#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;No wonder,&rdquo; he told a reporter, &ldquo;that Rough-House
Kelly thought the roof hit him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Chub Collins had been put out in the twelfth second of the
first round of a fifteen-round contest, Stubener felt compelled to
speak to Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what they&rsquo;re calling you now?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Pat shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Punch Glendon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat smiled politely. He was little interested in what he was called.
He had certain work cut out which he must do ere he could win back to
his mountains, and he was phlegmatically doing it, that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; his manager continued, with an
ominous shake of the head. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t go on putting your
men out so quickly. You must give them more time.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to fight, ain&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; Pat demanded
in surprise.</p>
<p>Again Stubener shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s this way, Pat. You&rsquo;ve got to be big and
generous in the fighting game. Don&rsquo;t get all the other fighters
sore. And it&rsquo;s not fair to the audience. They want a run for
their money. Besides, no one will fight you. They&rsquo;ll all be
scared out. And you can&rsquo;t draw crowds with ten-second fights. I
leave it to you. Would you pay a dollar, or five, to see a ten-second
fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat was convinced, and he promised to give future audiences the
requisite run for their money, though he stated that, personally, he
preferred going fishing to witnessing a hundred rounds of fighting.</p>
<p>And still, Pat had got practically nowhere in the game. The local
sports laughed when his name was mentioned. It called to mind funny
fights and Rough-House <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>Kelly&rsquo;s remark about the roof. Nobody
knew how Pat could fight. They had never seen him. Where was his wind,
his stamina, his ability to mix it with rough customers through long
grueling contests? He had demonstrated nothing but the possession of a
lucky punch and a depressing proclivity for flukes.</p>
<p>So it was that his fourth match was arranged with Pete Sosso, a
Portuguese fighter from Butchertown, known only for the amazing tricks
he played in the ring. Pat did not train for the fight. Instead he made
a flying and sorrowful trip to the mountains to bury his father. Old
Pat had known well the condition of his heart, and it had stopped
suddenly on him.</p>
<p>Young Pat arrived back in San Francisco with so close a margin of
time that he changed into his fighting togs <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>directly
from his traveling suit, and even then the audience was kept waiting
ten minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, give him a chance,&rdquo; Stubener cautioned him as
he climbed through the ropes. &ldquo;Play with him, but do it
seriously. Let him go ten or twelve rounds, then get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat obeyed instructions, and, though it would have been easy enough
to put Sosso out, so tricky was he that to stand up to him and not put
him out kept his hands full. It was a pretty exhibition, and the
audience was delighted. Sosso&rsquo;s whirlwind attacks, wild feints,
retreats, and rushes, required all Pat&rsquo;s science to protect
himself, and even then he did not escape unscathed.</p>
<p>Stubener praised him in the minute-rests, and all would have been
well, had not Sosso, in the fourth round, played one of his most
spectacular tricks. Pat, in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>mix-up, had landed a hook to
Sosso&rsquo;s jaw, when to his amazement, the latter dropped his hands
and reeled backward, eyes rolling, legs bending and giving, in a high
state of grogginess. Pat could not understand. It had not been a
knock-out blow, and yet there was his man all ready to fall to the mat.
Pat dropped his own hands and wonderingly watched his reeling opponent.
Sosso staggered away, almost fell, recovered, and staggered obliquely
and blindly forward again.</p>
<p>For the first and the last time in his fighting career, Pat was
caught off his guard. He actually stepped aside to let the reeling man
go by. Still reeling, Sosso suddenly loosed his right. Pat received it
full on his jaw with an impact that rattled all his teeth. A great roar
of delight went up from the audience. But Pat did not hear. He saw only
Sosso before him, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>grinning and defiant, and not the least bit
groggy. Pat was hurt by the blow, but vastly more outraged by the
trick. All the wrath that his father ever had surged up in him. He
shook his head as if to get rid of the shock of the blow and steadied
himself before his man. It all occurred in the next second. With a
feint that drew his opponent, Pat fetched his left to the solar plexus,
almost at the same instant whipping his right across to the jaw. The
latter blow landed on Sosso&rsquo;s mouth ere his falling body struck
the floor. The club doctors worked half an hour to bring him to. After
that they put eleven stitches in his mouth and packed him off in an
ambulance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Pat told his manager,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I lost my temper. I&rsquo;ll never do it again
in the ring. Dad always cautioned me about it. He said it had made him
lose more than one battle. I didn&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>know I could lose my
temper that way, but now that I know I&rsquo;ll keep it in
control.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Stubener believed him. He was coming to the stage where he could
believe anything about his young charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to get angry,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re so thoroughly the master of your man at any
stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any inch or second of the fight,&rdquo; Pat affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you can put them out any time you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I can. I don&rsquo;t want to boast. But I just seem to
possess the ability. My eyes show me the opening that my skill knows
how to make, and time and distance are second nature to me. Dad called
it a gift, but I thought he was blarneying me. Now that I&rsquo;ve been
up against these men, I guess he was right. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>He said
I had the mind and muscle correlation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any inch or second of the fight,&rdquo; Stubener repeated
musingly.</p>
<p>Pat nodded, and Stubener, absolutely believing him, caught a vision
of a golden future that should have fetched old Pat out of his
grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t forget, we&rsquo;ve got to give the crowd a
run for its money,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll fix it up between
us how many rounds a fight should go. Now your next bout will be with
the Flying Dutchman. Suppose you let it run the full fifteen and put
him out in the last round. That will give you a chance to make a
showing as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Sam,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a test for you,&rdquo; Stubener warned. &ldquo;You
may fail to put him out in that last round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch me.&rdquo; Pat paused to put <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>weight
to his promise, and picked up a volume of Longfellow. &ldquo;If I
don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll never read poetry again, and that&rsquo;s going
some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet it is,&rdquo; his manager proclaimed jubilantly,
&ldquo;though what you see in such stuff is beyond me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat sighed, but did not reply. In all his life he had found but one
person who cared for poetry, and that had been the red-haired school
teacher who scared him off into the woods. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Stubener demanded
in surprise, looking at his watch.</p>
<p>Pat, with his hand on the door-knob, paused and turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Academy of Sciences,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a professor who&rsquo;s going to give a lecture
there on Browning to-night, and Browning is the sort of writer you need
assistance with. Sometimes I think I ought to go to night
school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But great Scott, man!&rdquo; exclaimed the horrified manager.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on with the Flying Dutchman to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. But I won&rsquo;t enter the ring a moment before
half past nine or quarter to ten. The lecture will be over at
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>nine fifteen. If you want to make sure, come
around and pick me up in your machine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stubener shrugged his shoulders helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got no kick coming,&rdquo; Pat assured him.
&ldquo;Dad used to tell me a man&rsquo;s worst time was in the hours
just before a fight, and that many a fight was lost by a man&rsquo;s
breaking down right there, with nothing to do but think and be anxious.
Well, you&rsquo;ll never need to worry about me that way. You ought to
be glad I can go off to a lecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And later that night, in the course of watching fifteen splendid
rounds, Stubener chuckled to himself more than once at the idea of what
that audience of sports would think, did it know that this magnificent
young prize-fighter had come to the ring directly from a Browning
lecture. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Flying Dutchman was a young Swede who possessed an unwonted
willingness to fight and who was blessed with phenomenal endurance. He
never rested, was always on the offensive, and rushed and fought from
gong to gong. In the out-fighting his arms whirled about like flails,
in the in-fighting he was forever shouldering or half-wrestling and
starting blows whenever he could get a hand free. From start to finish
he was a whirlwind, hence his name. His failing was lack of judgment in
time and distance. Nevertheless he had won many fights by virtue of
landing one in each dozen or so of the unending fusillades of punches
he delivered. Pat, with strong upon him the caution that he must not
put his opponent out, was kept busy. Nor, though he escaped vital
damage, could he avoid entirely those eternal flying gloves. But it was
good training, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>and in a mild way he enjoyed the contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you get him now?&rdquo; Stubener whispered in his ear
during the minute rest at the end of the fifth round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was Pat&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he&rsquo;s never yet been knocked out by any
one,&rdquo; Stubener warned a couple of rounds later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to break my
knuckles,&rdquo; Pat smiled. &ldquo;I know the punch I&rsquo;ve got in
me, and when I land it something&rsquo;s got to go. If he won&rsquo;t,
my knuckles will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think you could get him now?&rdquo; Stubener asked at
the end of the thirteenth round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anytime, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, Pat, let him run to the fifteenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fourteenth round the Flying Dutchman exceeded himself. At the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>stroke of the gong he rushed clear across the ring
to the opposite corner where Pat was leisurely getting to his feet. The
house cheered, for it knew the Flying Dutchman had cut loose. Pat,
catching the fun of it, whimsically decided to meet the terrific
onslaught with a wholly passive defense and not to strike a blow. Nor
did he strike a blow, nor feint a blow, during the three minutes of
whirlwind that followed. He gave a rare exhibition of stalling,
sometimes hugging his bowed face with his left arm, his abdomen with
his right; at other times, changing as the point of attack changed, so
that both gloves were held on either side his face, or both elbows and
forearms guarded his mid-section; and all the time moving about,
clumsily shouldering, or half-falling forward against his opponent and
clogging his efforts; himself never striking nor threatening to strike,
the while <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>rocking with the impacts of the storming blows
that beat upon his various guards the devil&rsquo;s own tattoo.</p>
<p>Those close at the ringside saw and appreciated, but the rest of the
audience, fooled, arose to its feet and roared its applause in the
mistaken notion that Pat, helpless, was receiving a terrible beating.
With the end of the round, the audience, dumbfounded, sank back into
its seats as Pat walked steadily to his corner. It was not
understandable. He should have been beaten to a pulp, and yet nothing
had happened to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now are you going to get him?&rdquo; Stubener queried
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside ten seconds,&rdquo; was Pat&rsquo;s confident
assertion. &ldquo;Watch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no trick about it. When the gong struck and Pat bounded to
his feet, he advertised it unmistakably that for the first time in the
fight he was starting <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>after his man. Not one onlooker
misunderstood. The Flying Dutchman read the advertisement, too, and for
the first time in his career, as they met in the center of the ring,
visibly hesitated. For the fraction of a second they faced each other
in position. Then the Flying Dutchman leaped forward upon his man, and
Pat, with a timed right-cross, dropped him cold as he leaped.</p>
<p>It was after this battle that Pat Glendon started on his upward rush
to fame. The sports and the sporting writers took him up. For the first
time the Flying Dutchman had been knocked out. His conqueror had proved
a wizard of defense. His previous victories had not been flukes. He had
a kick in both his hands. Giant that he was, he would go far. The time
was already past, the writers asserted, for him to waste himself on the
third-raters and chopping <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href=
"#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>blocks. Where were Ben Menzies, Rege
Rede, Bill Tarwater, and Ernest Lawson? It was time for them to meet
this young cub that had suddenly shown himself a fighter of quality.
Where was his manager anyway, that he was not issuing the
challenges?</p>
<p>And then fame came in a day; for Stubener divulged the secret that
his man was none other than the son of Pat Glendon, Old Pat, the
old-time ring hero. &ldquo;Young&rdquo; Pat Glendon, he was promptly
christened, and sports and writers flocked about him to admire him, and
back him, and write him up.</p>
<p>Beginning with Ben Menzies and finishing with Bill Tarwater, he
challenged, fought, and knocked out the four second-raters. To do this,
he was compelled to travel, the battles taking place in Goldfield,
Denver, Texas, and New York. To accomplish it required months,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>for the bigger fights were not easily arranged,
and the men themselves demanded more time for training.</p>
<p>The second year saw him running to cover and disposing of the
half-dozen big fighters that clustered just beneath the top of the
heavyweight ladder. On this top, firmly planted, stood
&ldquo;Big&rdquo; Jim Hanford, the undefeated world champion. Here, on
the top rungs, progress was slower, though Stubener was indefatigable
in issuing challenges and in promoting sporting opinion to force the
man to fight. Will King was disposed of in England, and Glendon pursued
Tom Harrison half way around the world to defeat him on Boxing Day in
Australia.</p>
<p>But the purses grew larger and larger. In place of a hundred
dollars, such as his first battles had earned him, he was now receiving
from twenty to thirty thousand dollars a fight, as well as equally
large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>sums from the moving picture men. Stubener took
his manager&rsquo;s percentage of all this, according to the terms of
the contract old Pat had drawn up, and both he and Glendon, despite
their heavy expenses, were waxing rich. This was due, more than
anything else, to the clean lives they lived. They were not
wasters.</p>
<p>Stubener was attracted to real estate, and his holdings in San
Francisco, consisting of building flats and apartment houses, were
bigger than Glendon ever dreamed. There was a secret syndicate of
bettors, however, which could have made an accurate guess at the size
of Stubener&rsquo;s holdings, while heavy bonus after heavy bonus, of
which Glendon never heard, was paid over to his manager by the moving
picture men.</p>
<p>Stubener&rsquo;s most serious task was in maintaining the innocence
of his young gladiator. Nor did he find it difficult. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>Glendon,
who had nothing to do with the business end, was little interested.
Besides, wherever his travels took him, he spent his spare time in
hunting and fishing. He rarely mingled with those of the sporting
world, was notoriously shy and secluded, and preferred art galleries
and books of verse to sporting gossip. Also, his trainers and sparring
partners were rigorously instructed by the manager to keep their
tongues away from the slightest hints of ring rottenness. In every way
Stubener intervened between Glendon and the world. He was never even
interviewed save in Stubener&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Only once was Glendon approached. It was just prior to his battle
with Henderson, and an offer of a hundred thousand was made to him to
throw the fight. It was made hurriedly, in swift whispers, in a hotel
corridor, and it was fortunate for the man that Pat controlled his
temper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>and shouldered past him without reply. He brought
the tale of it to Stubener, who said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only con, Pat. They were trying to josh
you.&rdquo; He noted the blue eyes blaze. &ldquo;And maybe worse than
that. If they could have got you to fall for it, there might have been
a big sensation in the papers that would have finished you. But I doubt
it. Such things don&rsquo;t happen any more. It&rsquo;s a myth,
that&rsquo;s what it is, that has come down from the middle history of
the ring. There has been rottenness in the past, but no fighter or
manager of reputation would dare anything of the sort to-day. Why, Pat,
the men in the game are as clean and straight as those in professional
baseball, than which there is nothing cleaner or straighter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And all the while he talked, Stubener knew in his heart that the
forthcoming fight with Henderson was not to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>shorter
than twelve rounds&mdash;this for the moving pictures&mdash;and not
longer than the fourteenth round. And he knew, furthermore, so big were
the stakes involved, that Henderson himself was pledged not to last
beyond the fourteenth.</p>
<p>And Glendon, never approached again, dismissed the matter from his
mind and went out to spend the afternoon in taking color photographs.
The camera had become his latest hobby. Loving pictures, yet unable to
paint, he had compromised by taking up photography. In his hand baggage
was one grip packed with books on the subject, and he spent long hours
in the dark room, realizing for himself the various processes. Never
had there been a great fighter who was as aloof from the fighting world
as he. Because he had little to say with those he encountered, he was
called sullen and unsocial, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href=
"#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>and out of this a newspaper
reputation took form that was not an exaggeration so much as it was an
entire misconception. Boiled down, his character in print was that of
an ox-muscled and dumbly stupid brute, and one callow sporting writer
dubbed him the &ldquo;abysmal brute.&rdquo; The name stuck. The rest of
the fraternity hailed it with delight, and thereafter Glendon&rsquo;s
name never appeared in print unconnected with it. Often, in a headline
or under a photograph, &ldquo;The Abysmal Brute,&rdquo; capitalized and
without quotation marks, appeared alone. All the world knew who was
this brute. This made him draw into himself closer than ever, while it
developed a bitter prejudice against newspaper folk.</p>
<p>Regarding fighting itself, his earlier mild interest grew stronger.
The men he now fought were anything but dubs, and victory did not come
so easily. They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68" name=
"pb68">68</a>]</span>were picked men, experienced ring generals, and
each battle was a problem. There were occasions when he found it
impossible to put them out in any designated later round of a fight.
Thus, with Sulzberger, the gigantic German, try as he would in the
eighteenth round, he failed to get him, in the nineteenth it was the
same story, and not till the twentieth did he manage to break through
the baffling guard and drop him. Glendon&rsquo;s increasing enjoyment
of the game was accompanied by severer and prolonged training. Never
dissipating, spending much of his time on hunting trips in the hills,
he was practically always in the pink of condition, and, unlike his
father, no unfortunate accidents marred his career. He never broke a
bone, nor injured so much as a knuckle. One thing that Stubener noted
with secret glee was that his young fighter no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>longer
talked of going permanently back to his mountains when he had won the
championship away from Jim Hanford. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70"
href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span></p>
</div>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">VI</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The consummation of his career was rapidly
approaching. The great champion had even publicly intimated his
readiness to take on Glendon as soon as the latter had disposed of the
three or four aspirants for the championship who intervened. In six
months Pat managed to put away Kid McGrath and Philadelphia Jack
McBride, and there remained only Nat Powers and Tom Cannam. And all
would have been well had not a certain society girl gone adventuring
into journalism, and had not Stubener agreed to an interview with the
woman reporter of the San Francisco &ldquo;Courier-Journal.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Her work was always published over the name of Maud Sangster, which,
by the way, was her own name. The Sangsters were a notoriously wealthy
family. The founder, old Jacob Sangster, had packed his blankets and
worked as a farm-hand in the West. He had discovered an inexhaustible
borax deposit in Nevada, and, from hauling it out by mule-teams, had
built a railroad to do the freighting. Following that, he had poured
the profits of borax into the purchase of hundreds and thousands of
square miles of timber lands in California, Oregon, and Washington.
Still later, he had combined politics with business, bought statesmen,
judges, and machines, and become a captain of complicated industry. And
after that he had died, full of honor and pessimism, leaving his name a
muddy blot for future historians to smudge, and also leaving a matter
of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>couple of hundreds of millions for his four sons
to squabble over. The legal, industrial, and political battles that
followed, vexed and amused California for a generation, and culminated
in deadly hatred and unspeaking terms between the four sons. The
youngest, Theodore, in middle life experienced a change of heart, sold
out his stock farms and racing stables, and plunged into a fight with
all the corrupt powers of his native state, including most of its
millionaires, in a quixotic attempt to purge it of the infamy which had
been implanted by old Jacob Sangster.</p>
<p>Maud Sangster was Theodore&rsquo;s oldest daughter. The Sangster
stock uniformly bred fighters among the men and beauties among the
women. Nor was Maud an exception. Also, she must have inherited some of
the virus of adventure from the Sangster breed, for she had come to
womanhood <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>and done a multitude of things of which no woman
in her position should have been guilty. A match in ten thousand, she
remained unmarried. She had sojourned in Europe without bringing home a
nobleman for spouse, and had declined a goodly portion of her own set
at home. She had gone in for outdoor sports, won the tennis
championship of the state, kept the society weeklies agog with her
unconventionalities, walked from San Mateo to Santa Cruz against time
on a wager, and once caused a sensation by playing polo in a
men&rsquo;s team at a private Burlingame practice game. Incidentally,
she had gone in for art, and maintained a studio in San
Francisco&rsquo;s Latin Quarter.</p>
<p>All this had been of little moment until her father&rsquo;s reform
attack became acute. Passionately independent, never yet having met the
man to whom she could <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74"
name="pb74">74</a>]</span>gladly submit, and bored by those who had
aspired, she resented her father&rsquo;s interference with her way of
life and put the climax on all her social misdeeds by leaving home and
going to work on the &ldquo;Courier-Journal.&rdquo; Beginning at twenty
dollars a week, her salary had swiftly risen to fifty. Her work was
principally musical, dramatic, and art criticism, though she was not
above mere journalistic stunts if they promised to be sufficiently
interesting. Thus she scooped the big interview with Morgan at a time
when he was being futilely trailed by a dozen New York star
journalists, went down to the bottom of the Golden Gate in a
diver&rsquo;s suit, and flew with Rood, the bird man, when he broke all
records of continuous flight by reaching as far as Riverside.</p>
<p>Now it must not be imagined that Maud Sangster was a hard-bitten
Amazon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>On the contrary, she was a gray-eyed, slender
young woman, of three or four and twenty, of medium stature, and
possessing uncommonly small hands and feet for an outdoor woman or any
other kind of a woman. Also, far in excess of most outdoor women, she
knew how to be daintily feminine.</p>
<p>It was on her own suggestion that she received the editor&rsquo;s
commission to interview Pat Glendon. With the exception of having
caught a glimpse, once, of Bob Fitzsimmons in evening dress at the
Palace Grill, she had never seen a prizefighter in her life. Nor was
she curious to see one&mdash;at least she had not been curious until
Young Pat Glendon came to San Francisco to train for his fight with Nat
Powers. Then his newspaper reputation had aroused her. The Abysmal
Brute!&mdash;it certainly must be worth seeing. From what she read of
him she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>gleaned that he was a man-monster, profoundly
stupid and with the sullenness and ferocity of a jungle beast. True,
his published photographs did not show all that, but they did show the
hugeness of brawn that might be expected to go with it. And so,
accompanied by a staff photographer, she went out to the training
quarters at the Cliff House at the hour appointed by Stubener.</p>
<p>That real estate owner was having trouble. Pat was rebellious. He
sat, one big leg dangling over the side of the arm chair and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets face downward on his knee, orating against
the new woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they want to come butting into the game for?&rdquo;
he demanded. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not their place. What do they know about
it anyway? The men are bad enough as it is. I&rsquo;m not a holy show.
This woman&rsquo;s coming here to make me <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>one. I never have stood
for women around the training quarters, and I don&rsquo;t care if she
is a reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not an ordinary reporter,&rdquo; Stubener
interposed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve heard of the Sangsters?&mdash;the
millionaires?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s one of them. She&rsquo;s high society and
all that stuff. She could be running with the Blingum crowd now if she
wanted to instead of working for wages. Her old man&rsquo;s worth fifty
millions if he&rsquo;s worth a cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s she working on a paper for?&mdash;keeping
some poor devil out of a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and the old man fell out, had a tiff or something, about
the time he started to clean up San Francisco. She quit. That&rsquo;s
all&mdash;left home and got a job. And let me tell you one thing, Pat:
she can everlastingly sling English. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>There isn&rsquo;t a
pen-pusher on the Coast can touch her when she gets going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat began to show interest, and Stubener hurried on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She writes poetry, too&mdash;the regular la-de-dah stuff,
just like you. Only I guess hers is better, because she published a
whole book of it once. And she writes up the shows. She interviews
every big actor that hits this burg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her name in the papers,&rdquo; Pat
commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you have. And you&rsquo;re honored, Pat, by her coming
to interview you. It won&rsquo;t bother you any. I&rsquo;ll stick right
by and give her most of the dope myself. You know I&rsquo;ve always
done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat looked his gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing, Pat: don&rsquo;t forget you&rsquo;ve got
to put up with this interviewing. It&rsquo;s part of your business.
It&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>big advertising, and it comes free. We can&rsquo;t
buy it. It interests people, draws the crowds, and it&rsquo;s crowds
that pile up the gate receipts.&rdquo; He stopped and listened, then
looked at his watch. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s her now. I&rsquo;ll go
and get her and bring her in. I&rsquo;ll tip it off to her to cut it
short, you know, and it won&rsquo;t take long.&rdquo; He turned in the
doorway. &ldquo;And be decent, Pat. Don&rsquo;t shut up like a clam.
Talk a bit to her when she asks you questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat put the Sonnets on the table, took up a newspaper, and was
apparently deep in its contents when the two entered the room and he
stood up. The meeting was a mutual shock. When blue eyes met gray, it
was almost as if the man and the woman shouted triumphantly to each
other, as if each had found something sought and unexpected. But this
was for the instant only. Each had anticipated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>in the
other something so totally different that the next moment the clear cry
of recognition gave way to confusion. As is the way of women, she was
the first to achieve control, and she did it without having given any
outward sign that she had ever lost it. She advanced most of the
distance across the floor to meet Glendon. As for him, he scarcely knew
how he stumbled through the introduction. Here was a woman, a WOMAN. He
had not known that such a creature could exist. The few women he had
noticed had never prefigured this. He wondered what Old Pat&rsquo;s
judgment would have been of her, if she was the sort he had recommended
to hang on to with both his hands. He discovered that in some way he
was holding her hand. He looked at it, curious and fascinated,
marveling at its fragility.</p>
<p>She, on the other hand, had proceeded <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>to obliterate the echoes
of that first clear call. It had been a peculiar experience, that was
all, this sudden out-rush of her toward this strange man. For was not
he the abysmal brute of the prize-ring, the great, fighting, stupid
bulk of a male animal who hammered up his fellow males of the same
stupid order? She smiled at the way he continued to hold her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it back, please, Mr. Glendon,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I &hellip; I really need it, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her blankly, followed her gaze to her imprisoned hand,
and dropped it in a rush of awkwardness that sent the blood in a
manifest blush to his face.</p>
<p>She noted the blush, and the thought came to her that he did not
seem quite the uncouth brute she had pictured. She could not conceive
of a brute blushing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>at anything. And also, she found herself
pleased with the fact that he lacked the easy glibness to murmur an
apology. But the way he devoured her with his eyes was disconcerting.
He stared at her as if in a trance, while his cheeks flushed even more
redly.</p>
<p>Stubener by this time had fetched a chair for her, and Glendon
automatically sank down into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in fine shape, Miss Sangster, in fine
shape,&rdquo; the manager was saying. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,
isn&rsquo;t it, Pat? Never felt better in your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon was bothered by this. His brows contracted in a troubled
way, and he made no reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wanted to meet you for a long time, Mr.
Glendon,&rdquo; Miss Sangster said. &ldquo;I never interviewed a
pugilist before, so if I don&rsquo;t go about it expertly you&rsquo;ll
forgive me, I am sure.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href=
"#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better start in by seeing him in
action,&rdquo; was the manager&rsquo;s suggestion. &ldquo;While
he&rsquo;s getting into his fighting togs I can tell you a lot about
him&mdash;fresh stuff, too. We&rsquo;ll call in Walsh, Pat, and go a
couple of rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; Glendon growled
roughly, in just the way an abysmal brute should. &ldquo;Go ahead with
the interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The business went ahead unsatisfactorily. Stubener did most of the
talking and suggesting, which was sufficient to irritate Maud Sangster,
while Pat volunteered nothing. She studied his fine countenance, the
eyes clear blue and wide apart, the well-modeled, almost aquiline,
nose, the firm, chaste lips that were sweet in a masculine way in their
curl at the corners and that gave no hint of any sullenness. It was a
baffling personality, she concluded, if what the papers said of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>him was so. In vain she sought for earmarks of the
brute. And in vain she attempted to establish contacts. For one thing,
she knew too little about prize-fighters and the ring, and whenever she
opened up a lead it was promptly snatched away by the
information-oozing Stubener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be most interesting, this life of a pugilist,&rdquo;
she said once, adding with a sigh, &ldquo;I wish I knew more about it.
Tell me: why do you fight?&mdash;Oh, aside from money reasons.&rdquo;
(This latter to forestall Stubener). &ldquo;Do you enjoy fighting? Are
you stirred by it, by pitting yourself against other men? I hardly know
how to express what I mean, so you must be patient with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat and Stubener began speaking together, but for once Pat bore his
manager down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care for it at first&mdash;&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, it was too dead easy for him,&rdquo; Stubener
interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But later,&rdquo; Pat went on, &ldquo;when I encountered the
better fighters, the real big clever ones, where I was
more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your mettle?&rdquo; she suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s it, more on my mettle, I found I did care
for it &hellip; a great deal, in fact. But still, it&rsquo;s not so
absorbing to me as it might be. You see, while each battle is a sort of
problem which I must work out with my wits and muscle, yet to me the
issue is never in doubt&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s never had a fight go to a decision,&rdquo;
Stubener proclaimed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s won every battle by the
knock-out route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s this certainty of the outcome that robs it of
what I imagine must be its finest thrills,&rdquo; Pat concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;ll get some of them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>thrills
when you go up against Jim Hanford,&rdquo; said the manager.</p>
<p>Pat smiled, but did not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me some more,&rdquo; she urged, &ldquo;more about the
way you feel when you are fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Pat amazed his manager, Miss Sangster, and himself, by
blurting out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me I don&rsquo;t want to talk with you on such
things. It&rsquo;s as if there are things more important for you and me
to talk about. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped abruptly, aware of what he was saying but unaware of why
he was saying it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. That
is what makes a good interview&mdash;the real personality, you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Pat remained tongue-tied, and Stubener wandered away on a
statistical comparison of his champion&rsquo;s weights, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>measurements, and expansions with those of Sandow,
the Terrible Turk, Jeffries, and the other modern strong men. This was
of little interest to Maud Sangster, and she showed that she was bored.
Her eyes chanced to rest on the Sonnets. She picked the book up and
glanced inquiringly at Stubener.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Pat&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He goes in
for that kind of stuff, and color photography, and art exhibits, and
such things. But for heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t publish anything
about it. It would ruin his reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked accusingly at Glendon, who immediately became awkward. To
her it was delicious. A shy young man, with the body of a giant, who
was one of the kings of bruisers, and who read poetry, and went to art
exhibits, and experimented with color photography! Of a surety there
was no abysmal brute here. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>His very shyness she divined now was
due to sensitiveness and not stupidity. Shakespeare&rsquo;s Sonnets!
This was a phase that would bear investigation. But Stubener stole the
opportunity away and was back chanting his everlasting statistics.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, and most unwittingly, she opened up the biggest
lead of all. That first sharp attraction toward him had begun to stir
again after the discovery of the Sonnets. The magnificent frame of his,
the handsome face, the chaste lips, the clear-looking eyes, the fine
forehead which the short crop of blond hair did not hide, the aura of
physical well-being and cleanness which he seemed to emanate&mdash;all
this, and more that she sensed, drew her as she had never been drawn by
any man, and yet through her mind kept running the nasty rumors that
she had heard only <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>the day before at the
&ldquo;Courier-Journal&rdquo; office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is something
more important to talk about. There is something in my mind I want you
to reconcile for me. Do you mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am frank?&mdash;abominably frank? I&rsquo;ve heard the
men, sometimes, talking of particular fights and of the betting odds,
and, while I gave no heed to it at the time, it seemed to me it was
firmly agreed that there was a great deal of trickery and cheating
connected with the sport. Now, when I look at you, for instance, I find
it hard to understand how you can be a party to such cheating. I can
understand your liking the sport for a sport, as well as for the money
it brings you, but I can&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to understand,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>Stubener
broke in, while Pat&rsquo;s lips were wreathed in a gentle, tolerant
smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all fairy tales, this talk about faking, about
fixed fights, and all that rot. There&rsquo;s nothing to it, Miss
Sangster, I assure you. And now let me tell you about how I discovered
Mr. Glendon. It was a letter I got from his father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Maud Sangster refused to be side-tracked, and addressed herself
to Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. I remember one case particularly. It was some fight
that took place several months ago&mdash;I forget the contestants. One
of the editors of the &ldquo;Courier-Journal&rdquo; told me he intended
to make a good winning. He didn&rsquo;t hope; he said he intended. He
said he was on the inside and was betting on the number of rounds. He
told me the fight would end in the nineteenth. This was the night
before. And the next day he triumphantly called my attention to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>fact that it had ended in that very round. I
didn&rsquo;t think anything of it one way or the other. I was not
interested in prize-fighting then. But I am now. At the time it seemed
quite in accord with the vague conception I had about fighting. So you
see, it isn&rsquo;t all fairy tales, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that fight,&rdquo; Glendon said. &ldquo;It was Owen
and Murgweather. And it did end in the nineteenth round, Sam. And she
said she heard that round named the day before. How do you account for
it, Sam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you account for a man picking a lucky lottery
ticket?&rdquo; the manager evaded, while getting his wits together to
answer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very point. Men who study form and
condition and seconds and rules and such things often pick the number
of rounds, just as men have been known to pick hundred-to-one shots in
the races. And don&rsquo;t forget one thing: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>for
every man that wins, there&rsquo;s another that loses, there&rsquo;s
another that didn&rsquo;t pick right. Miss Sangster, I assure you, on
my honor, that faking and fixing in the fight game is &hellip; is
non-existent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your opinion, Mr. Glendon?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same as mine,&rdquo; Stubener snatched the answer.
&ldquo;He knows what I say is true, every word of it. He&rsquo;s never
fought anything but a straight fight in his life. Isn&rsquo;t that
right, Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Pat affirmed, and the peculiar
thing to Maud Sangster was that she was convinced he spoke the
truth.</p>
<p>She brushed her forehead with her hand, as if to rid herself of the
bepuzzlement that clouded her brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Last night the same editor
told me that your forthcoming <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>fight was arranged to the very round
in which it would end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stubener was verging on a panic, but Pat&rsquo;s speech saved him
from replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the editor lies,&rdquo; Pat&rsquo;s voice boomed now for
the first time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not lie before, about that other fight,&rdquo; she
challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What round did he say my fight with Nat Powers would end
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before she could answer, the manager was into the thick of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, rats, Pat!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Shut up. It&rsquo;s
only the regular run of ring rumors. Let&rsquo;s get on with this
interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was ignored by Glendon, whose eyes, bent on hers, were no longer
mildly blue, but harsh and imperative. She was sure now that she had
stumbled on something tremendous, something that would explain all that
had baffled her. At the same time she thrilled to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>mastery
of his voice and gaze. Here was a male man who would take hold of life
and shake out of it what he wanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What round did the editor say?&rdquo; Glendon reiterated his
demand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of Mike, Pat, stop this foolishness,&rdquo;
Stubener broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would give me a chance to answer,&rdquo; Maud
Sangster said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m able to talk with Miss Sangster,&rdquo;
Glendon added. &ldquo;You get out, Sam. Go off and take care of that
photographer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at each other for a tense, silent moment, then the
manager moved slowly to the door, opened it, and turned his head to
listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now what round did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I haven&rsquo;t made a mistake,&rdquo; she said
tremulously, &ldquo;but I am very sure that he said the sixteenth
round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She saw surprise and anger leap into <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>Glendon&rsquo;s face, and
the anger and accusation in the glance he cast at his manager, and she
knew the blow had driven home.</p>
<p>And there was reason for his anger. He knew he had talked it over
with Stubener, and they had reached a decision to give the audience a
good run for its money without unnecessarily prolonging the fight, and
to end it in the sixteenth. And here was a woman, from a newspaper
office, naming the very round.</p>
<p>Stubener, in the doorway, looked limp and pale, and it was evident
he was holding himself together by an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later,&rdquo; Pat told him. &ldquo;Shut
the door behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed, and the two were left alone. Glendon did not speak.
The expression on his face was frankly one of trouble and
perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He got up and towered above her, then <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>sat down again,
moistening his lips with his tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing,&rdquo; he finally said
&ldquo;The fight won&rsquo;t end in the sixteenth round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not speak, but her unconvinced and quizzical smile hurt
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait and see, Miss Sangster, and you&rsquo;ll see that
editor man is mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the program is to be changed?&rdquo; she queried
audaciously.</p>
<p>He quivered to the cut of her words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not accustomed to lying,&rdquo; he said stiffly,
&ldquo;even to women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have you to me, nor have you denied the program is to
be changed. Perhaps, Mr. Glendon, I am stupid, but I fail to see the
difference in what number the final round occurs so long as it is
predetermined and known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that round, and not another soul shall
know.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds to me very much like a racing tip. They are always
given that way, you know. Furthermore, I am not quite stupid, and I
know there is something wrong here. Why were you made angry by my
naming the round? Why were you angry with your manager? Why did you
send him from the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For reply, Glendon walked over to the window, as if to look out,
where he changed his mind and partly turned, and she knew, without
seeing, that he was studying her face. He came back and sat down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve said I haven&rsquo;t lied to you, Miss Sangster,
and you were right. I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He paused, groping
painfully for a correct statement of the situation. &ldquo;Now do you
think you can believe what I am going to tell you? Will you take the
word of a &hellip; prize-fighter?&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span></p>
<p>She nodded gravely, looking him straight in the eyes and certain
that what he was about to tell was the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always fought straight and square. I&rsquo;ve
never touched a piece of dirty money in my life, nor attempted a dirty
trick. Now I can go on from that. You&rsquo;ve shaken me up pretty
badly by what you told me. I don&rsquo;t know what to make of it. I
can&rsquo;t pass a snap judgment on it. I don&rsquo;t know. But it
looks bad. That&rsquo;s what troubles me. For see you, Stubener and I
have talked this fight over, and it was understood between us that I
would end the fight in the sixteenth round. Now you bring the same
word. How did that editor know? Not from me. Stubener must have let it
out &hellip; unless&#8202;&hellip;.&rdquo; He stopped to debate the
problem. &ldquo;Unless that editor is a lucky guesser. I can&rsquo;t
make up my mind about it. I&rsquo;ll have to keep my eyes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>open and
wait and learn. Every word I&rsquo;ve given you is straight, and
there&rsquo;s my hand on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he towered out of his chair and over to her. Her small hand
was gripped in his big one as she arose to meet him, and after a fair,
straight look into the eyes between them, both glanced unconsciously at
the clasped hands. She felt that she had never been more aware that she
was a woman. The sex emphasis of those two hands&mdash;the soft and
fragile feminine and the heavy, muscular masculine&mdash;was startling.
Glendon was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be hurt so easily,&rdquo; he said; and at the same
time she felt the firmness of his grip almost caressingly relax.</p>
<p>She remembered the old Prussian king&rsquo;s love for giants, and
laughed at the incongruity of the thought-association as she withdrew
her hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you came here to-day,&rdquo; he said, then hurried
on awkwardly to make an explanation which the warm light of admiration
in his eyes belied. &ldquo;I mean because maybe you have opened my eyes
to the crooked dealing that has been going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have surprised me,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;It seemed to
me that it is so generally understood that prize-fighting is full of
crookedness, that I cannot understand how you, one of its chief
exponents, could be ignorant of it. I thought as a matter of course
that you would know all about it, and now you have convinced me that
you never dreamed of it. You must be different from other
fighters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains it, I guess. And that&rsquo;s what comes of
keeping away from it&mdash;from the other fighters, and promoters, and
sports. It was easy to pull the wool <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>over my eyes. Yet it
remains to be seen whether it has really been pulled over or not. You
see, I am going to find out for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And change it?&rdquo; she queried, rather breathlessly,
convinced somehow that he could do anything he set out to
accomplish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; quit it,&rdquo; was his answer. &ldquo;If it isn&rsquo;t
straight I won&rsquo;t have anything more to do with it. And one thing
is certain: this coming fight with Nat Powers won&rsquo;t end in the
sixteenth round. If there is any truth in that editor&rsquo;s tip,
they&rsquo;ll all be fooled. Instead of putting him out in the
sixteenth, I&rsquo;ll let the fight run on into the twenties. You wait
and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not to tell the editor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was on her feet now, preparing to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. If he is only guessing, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>let
him take his chances. And if there&rsquo;s anything rotten about it he
deserves to lose all he bets. This is to be a little secret between you
and me. I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll name the
round to you. I won&rsquo;t run it into the twenties. I&rsquo;ll stop
Nat Powers in the eighteenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll not whisper it,&rdquo; she assured him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask you a favor,&rdquo; he said
tentatively. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a big favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She showed her acquiescence in her face, as if it were already
granted, and he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I know you won&rsquo;t use this faking in the
interview. But I want more than that. I don&rsquo;t want you to publish
anything at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him a quick look with her searching gray eyes, then
surprised herself by her answer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103"
href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It will not be published.
I won&rsquo;t write a line of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>For the moment she was disappointed by the lack of thanks, and the
next moment she was glad that he had not thanked her. She sensed the
different foundation he was building under this meeting of an hour with
her, and she became daringly explorative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; He shook his head. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t explain it. I knew it as a matter of course. Somehow it
seems to me I know a lot about you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not publish the interview? As your manager says, it
is good advertising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; he answered slowly. &ldquo;But I
don&rsquo;t want to know you that way. I think it would hurt if you
should publish it. I don&rsquo;t want to think that I knew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>you
professionally. I&rsquo;d like to remember our talk here as a talk
between a man and a woman. I don&rsquo;t know whether you understand
what I&rsquo;m driving at. But it&rsquo;s the way I feel. I want to
remember this just as a man and a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke, in his eyes was all the expression with which a man
looks at a woman. She felt the force and beat of him, and she felt
strangely tongue-tied and awkward before this man who had been reputed
tongue-tied and awkward. He could certainly talk straighter to the
point and more convincingly than most men, and what struck her most
forcibly was her own inborn certainty that it was mere na&iuml;ve and
simple frankness on his part and not a practised artfulness.</p>
<p>He saw her into her machine, and gave her another thrill when he
said good-by. Once again their hands were clasped as he said:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name=
"pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I&rsquo;ll see you again. I want to see you again.
Somehow I have a feeling that the last word has not been said between
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as the machine rolled away she was aware of a similar feeling.
She had not seen the last of this very disquieting Pat Glendon, king of
the bruisers and abysmal brute.</p>
<p>Back in the training quarters, Glendon encountered his perturbed
manager.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you fire me out for?&rdquo; Stubener demanded.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re finished. A hell of a mess you&rsquo;ve made.
You&rsquo;ve never stood for meeting a reporter alone before, and now
you&rsquo;ll see when that interview comes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon, who had been regarding him with cool amusement, made as if
to turn and pass on, and then changed his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t come out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Stubener looked up sharply. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106"
href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her not to,&rdquo; Glendon explained.</p>
<p>Then Stubener exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if she&rsquo;d kill a juicy thing like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon became very cold and his voice was harsh and grating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be published. She told me so. And to doubt it
is to call her a liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Irish flame was in his eyes, and by that, and by the unconscious
clenching of his passion-wrought hands, Stubener, who knew the strength
of them, and of the man he faced, no longer dared to doubt.

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">VII</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It did not take Stubener long to find out that Glendon
intended extending the distance of the fight, though try as he would he
could get no hint of the number of the round. He wasted no time,
however, and privily clinched certain arrangements with Nat Powers and
Nat Powers&rsquo; manager. Powers had a faithful following of bettors,
and the betting syndicate was not to be denied its harvest.</p>
<p>On the night of the fight, Maud Sangster was guilty of a more daring
unconventionality than any she had yet committed, though no whisper of
it leaked out to shock society. Under the protection of the editor, she
occupied a ring-side <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108"
name="pb108">108</a>]</span>seat. Her hair and most of her face were
hidden under a slouch hat, while she wore a man&rsquo;s long overcoat
that fell to her heels. Entering in the thick of the crowd, she was not
noticed; nor did the newspaper men, in the press seats against the ring
directly in front of her, recognize her.</p>
<p>As was the growing custom, there were no preliminary bouts, and she
had barely gained her seat when roars of applause announced the arrival
of Nat Powers. He came down the aisle in the midst of his seconds, and
she was almost frightened by the formidable bulk of him. Yet he leaped
the ropes as lightly as a man half his weight, and grinned
acknowledgment to the tumultuous greeting that arose from all the
house. He was not pretty. Two cauliflower ears attested his profession
and its attendant brutality, while his broken nose had been so often
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>spread over his face as to defy the
surgeon&rsquo;s art to reconstruct it.</p>
<p>Another uproar heralded the arrival of Glendon, and she watched him
eagerly as he went through the ropes to his corner. But it was not
until the tedious time of announcements, introductions, and challenges
was over, that the two men threw off their wraps and faced each other
in ring costume. Concentrated upon them from overhead was the white
glare of many electric lights&mdash;this for the benefit of the moving
picture cameras; and she felt, as she looked at the two sharply
contrasted men, that it was in Glendon that she saw the thoroughbred
and in Powers the abysmal brute. Both looked their parts&mdash;Glendon,
clean cut in face and form, softly and massively beautiful, Powers
almost asymmetrically rugged and heavily matted with hair.</p>
<p>As they made their preliminary pose <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>for the cameras,
confronting each other in fighting attitudes, it chanced that
Glendon&rsquo;s gaze dropped down through the ropes and rested on her
face. Though he gave no sign, she knew, with a swift leap of the heart,
that he had recognized her. The next moment the gong sounded, the
announcer cried &ldquo;Let her go!&rdquo; and the battle was on.</p>
<p>It was a good fight. There was no blood, no marring, and both were
clever. Half of the first round was spent in feeling each other out,
but Maud Sangster found the play and feint and tap of the gloves
sufficiently exciting. During some of the fiercer rallies in later
stages of the fight, the editor was compelled to touch her arm to
remind her who she was and where she was.</p>
<p>Powers fought easily and cleanly, as became the hero of half a
hundred ring battles, and an admiring claque applauded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>his
every cleverness. Yet he did not unduly exert himself save in
occasional strenuous rallies that brought the audience yelling to its
feet in the mistaken notion that he was getting his man.</p>
<p>It was at such a moment, when her unpractised eye could not inform
her that Glendon was escaping serious damage, that the editor leaned to
her and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Pat will win all right. He&rsquo;s a comer, and they
can&rsquo;t stop him. But he&rsquo;ll win in the sixteenth and not
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or after?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>She almost laughed at the certitude of her companion&rsquo;s
negative. She knew better.</p>
<p>Powers was noted for hunting his man from moment to moment and round
to round, and Glendon was content to accede to this program. His
defense was admirable, and he threw in just enough of offense to whet
the edge of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112"
name="pb112">112</a>]</span>audience&rsquo;s interest. Though he knew
he was scheduled to lose, Powers had had too long a ring experience to
hesitate from knocking his man out if the opportunity offered. He had
had the double cross worked too often on him to be chary in working it
on others. If he got his chance he was prepared to knock his man out
and let the syndicate go hang. Thanks to clever press publicity, the
idea was prevalent that at last Young Glendon had met his master. In
his heart, Powers, however, knew that it was himself who had
encountered the better man. More than once, in the faster in-fighting,
he received the weight of punches that he knew had been deliberately
made no heavier.</p>
<p>On Glendon&rsquo;s part, there were times and times when a slip or
error of judgment could have exposed him to one of his
antagonist&rsquo;s sledge-hammer blows and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>lost
him the fight. Yet his was that almost miraculous power of accurate
timing and distancing, and his confidence was not shaken by the several
close shaves he experienced. He had never lost a fight, never been
knocked down, and he had always been so thoroughly the master of the
man he faced, that such a possibility was unthinkable.</p>
<p>At the end of the fifteenth round, both men were in good condition,
though Powers was breathing a trifle heavily and there were men in the
ringside seats offering odds that he would &ldquo;blow up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was just before the gong for the sixteenth round struck that
Stubener, leaning over Glendon from behind in his corner,
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to get him now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon, with a back toss of his head, shook it and laughed
mockingly up into his manager&rsquo;s anxious face. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p>With the stroke of the gong for the sixteenth round, Glendon was
surprised to see Powers cut loose. From the first second it was a
tornado of fighting, and Glendon was hard put to escape serious damage.
He blocked, clinched, ducked, sidestepped, was rushed backward against
the ropes and was met by fresh rushes when he surged out to center.
Several times Powers left inviting openings, but Glendon refused to
loose the lightning-bolt of a blow that would drop his man. He was
reserving that blow for two rounds later. Not in the whole fight had he
ever exerted his full strength, nor struck with the force that was in
him.</p>
<p>For two minutes, without the slightest let-up, Powers went at him
hammer and tongs. In another minute the round would be over and the
betting <span class="corr" id="xd26e1089" title=
"Source: snydicate">syndicate</span> hard hit. But that minute was not
to be. They had just come together in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb115" href="#pb115" name="pb115">115</a>]</span>center of the ring.
It was as ordinary a clinch as any in the fight, save that Powers was
struggling and roughing it every instant. Glendon whipped his left over
in a crisp but easy jolt to the side of the face. It was like any of a
score of similar jolts he had already delivered in the course of the
fight. To his amazement he felt Powers go limp in his arms and begin
sinking to the floor on sagging, spraddling legs that refused to bear
his weight. He struck the floor with a thump, rolled half over on his
side, and lay with closed eyes and motionless. The referee, bending
above him, was shouting the count.</p>
<p>At the cry of &ldquo;Nine!&rdquo; Powers quivered as if making a
vain effort to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten!&mdash;and out!&rdquo; cried the referee.</p>
<p>He caught Glendon&rsquo;s hand and raised it aloft to the roaring
audience in token that he was the winner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>For the first time in the ring, Glendon was dazed. It had not been a
knockout blow. He could stake his life on that. It had not been to the
jaw but to the side of the face, and he knew it had gone there and
nowhere else. Yet the man was out, had been counted out, and he had
faked it beautifully. That final thump on the floor had been a
convincing masterpiece. To the audience it was indubitably a knockout,
and the moving picture machines would perpetuate the lie. The editor
had called the turn after all, and a crooked turn it was.</p>
<p>Glendon shot a swift glance through the ropes to the face of Maud
Sangster. She was looking straight at him, but her eyes were bleak and
hard, and there was neither recognition nor expression in them. Even as
he looked, she turned away unconcernedly and said something to the man
beside her. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span></p>
<p>Powers&rsquo; seconds were carrying him to his corner, a seeming
limp wreck of a man. Glendon&rsquo;s seconds were advancing upon him to
congratulate him and to remove his gloves. But Stubener was ahead of
them. His face was beaming as he caught Glendon&rsquo;s right glove in
both his hands and cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good boy, Pat. I knew you&rsquo;d do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon pulled his glove away. And for the first time in the years
they had been together, his manager heard him swear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go to hell,&rdquo; he said, and turned to hold out his
hands for his seconds to pull off the gloves. <span class=

<p class="first">That night, after receiving the editor&rsquo;s final
dictum that there was not a square fighter in the game, Maud Sangster
cried quietly for a moment on the edge of her bed, grew angry, and went
to sleep hugely disgusted with herself, prize-fighters, and the world
in general.</p>
<p>The next afternoon she began work on an interview with Henry Addison
that was destined never to be finished. It was in the private room that
was accorded her at the &ldquo;Courier-Journal&rdquo; office that the
thing happened. She had paused in her writing to glance at a headline
in the afternoon paper announcing that Glendon was matched with Tom
Cannam, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>one of the door-boys brought in a card. It was
Glendon&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him I can&rsquo;t be seen,&rdquo; she told the boy.</p>
<p>In a minute he was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says he&rsquo;s coming in anyway, but he&rsquo;d rather
have your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you tell him I was busy?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m, but he said he was coming just the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no answer, and the boy, his eyes shining with admiration
for the importunate visitor, rattled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know&rsquo;m. He&rsquo;s a awful big guy. If he started
roughhousing he could clean the whole office out. He&rsquo;s young
Glendon, who won the fight last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then. Bring him in. We don&rsquo;t want the office
cleaned out, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No greetings were exchanged when <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>Glendon entered. She
was as cold and inhospitable as a gray day, and neither invited him to
a chair nor recognized him with her eyes, sitting half turned away from
him at her desk and waiting for him to state his business. He gave no
sign of how this cavalier treatment affected him, but plunged directly
into his subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you,&rdquo; he said shortly. &ldquo;That
fight. It did end in that round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;You
didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned and looked at him with quiet affectation of boredom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Prize-fighting is
prize-fighting, and we all know what it means. The fight did end in the
round I told you it would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>know it would. In all the world you and I were
at least two that knew Powers wouldn&rsquo;t be knocked out in the
sixteenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say you knew he wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He spoke
peremptorily, and, when she still declined to speak, stepped nearer to
her. &ldquo;Answer me,&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was,&rdquo; she insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t. He wasn&rsquo;t knocked out at all. Do you
get that? I am going to tell you about it, and you are going to listen.
I didn&rsquo;t lie to you. Do you get that? I didn&rsquo;t lie to you.
I was a fool, and they fooled me, and you along with me. You thought
you saw him knocked out. Yet the blow I struck was not heavy enough. It
didn&rsquo;t hit him in the right place either. He made believe it did.
He faked that knockout.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>He paused and looked at her expectantly. And somehow, with a leap
and thrill, she knew that she believed him, and she felt pervaded by a
warm happiness at the reinstatement of this man who meant nothing to
her and whom she had seen but twice in her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he demanded, and she thrilled anew at the
compellingness of him.</p>
<p>She stood up, and her hand went out to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I am glad, most
glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a longer grip than she had anticipated. He looked at her with
eyes that burned and to which her own unconsciously answered back.
Never was there such a man, was her thought. Her eyes dropped first,
and his followed, so that, as before, both gazed at the clasped hands.
He made a movement of his whole body toward her, impulsive and
involuntary, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"
name="pb123">123</a>]</span>if to gather her to him, then checked
himself abruptly, with an unmistakable effort. She saw it, and felt the
pull of his hand as it started to draw her to him. And to her amazement
she felt the desire to yield, the desire almost overwhelmingly to be
drawn into the strong circle of those arms. And had he compelled, she
knew that she would not have refrained. She was almost dizzy, when he
checked himself and with a closing of his fingers that half crushed
hers, dropped her hand, almost flung it from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;You were made for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned partly away from her, sweeping his hand to his forehead.
She knew she would hate him forever if he dared one stammered word of
apology or explanation. But he seemed to have the way always of doing
the right thing where she was concerned. She sank into <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>her
chair, and he into another, first drawing it around so as to face her
across the corner of the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spent last night in a Turkish bath,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I sent for an old broken-down bruiser. He was a friend of my
father in the old days. I knew there couldn&rsquo;t be a thing about
the ring he didn&rsquo;t know, and I made him talk. The funny thing was
that it was all I could do to convince him that I didn&rsquo;t know the
things I asked him about. He called me the babe in the woods. I guess
he was right. I was raised in the woods, and woods is about all I
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I received an education from that old man last night.
The ring is rottener than you told me. It seems everybody connected
with it is crooked. The very supervisors that grant the fight permits
graft off of the promoters; and the promoters, managers, and fighters
graft <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>off of each other and off the public. It&rsquo;s
down to a system, in one way, and on the other hand they&rsquo;re
always&mdash;do you know what the double cross is?&rdquo; (She nodded.)
&ldquo;Well, they don&rsquo;t seem to miss a chance to give each other
the double cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stuff that old man told me took my breath away. And here
I&rsquo;ve been in the thick of it for several years and knew nothing
of it. I was a real babe in the woods. And yet I can see how I&rsquo;ve
been fooled. I was so made that nobody could stop me. I was bound to
win, and, thanks to Stubener, everything crooked was kept away from me.
This morning I cornered Spider Walsh and made him talk. He was my first
trainer, you know, and he followed Stubener&rsquo;s instructions. They
kept me in ignorance. Besides, I didn&rsquo;t herd with the sporting
crowd. I spent my time hunting and fishing and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>monkeying with cameras and such things. Do you
know what Walsh and Stubener called me between themselves?&mdash;the
Virgin. I only learned it this morning from Walsh, and it was like
pulling teeth. And they were right. I was a little innocent lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Stubener was using me for crookedness, too, only I
didn&rsquo;t know it. I can look back now and see how it was worked.
But you see, I wasn&rsquo;t interested enough in the game to be
suspicious. I was born with a good body and a cool head, I was raised
in the open, and I was taught by my father, who knew more about
fighting than any man living or dead. It was too easy. The ring
didn&rsquo;t absorb me. There was never any doubt of the outcome. But
I&rsquo;m done with it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the headline announcing his match with Tom Cannam.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Stubener&rsquo;s work,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;It was programmed months ago. But I don&rsquo;t care. I&rsquo;m
heading for the mountains. I&rsquo;ve quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at the unfinished interview on the desk and sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How lordly men are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Masters of
destiny. They do as they please&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; he interrupted,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve done pretty much as you please. It&rsquo;s one of
the things I like about you. And what has struck me hard from the first
was the way you and I understand each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off and looked at her with burning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the ring did one thing for me,&rdquo; he went on.
&ldquo;It made me acquainted with you. And when you find the one woman,
there&rsquo;s just one thing to do. Take her in your two hands and
don&rsquo;t <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>let go. Come on, let us start for the
mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had come with the suddenness of a thunder-clap, and yet she felt
that she had been expecting it. Her heart was beating up and almost
choking her in a strangely delicious way. Here at least was the
primitive and the simple with a vengeance. Then, too, it seemed a
dream. Such things did not take place in modern newspaper offices. Love
could not be made in such fashion; it only so occurred on the stage and
in novels.</p>
<p>He had arisen, and was holding out both hands to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare,&rdquo; she said in a whisper, half to
herself. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And thereat she was stung by the quick contempt that flashed in his
eyes but that swiftly changed to open incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d dare anything you wanted,&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>he
was saying. &ldquo;I know that. It&rsquo;s not a case of dare, but of
want. Do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had arisen, and was now swaying as if in a dream. It flashed
into her mind to wonder if it were hypnotism. She wanted to glance
about her at the familiar objects of the room in order to identify
herself with reality, but she could not take her eyes from his. Nor did
she speak.</p>
<p>He had stepped beside her. His hand was on her arm, and she leaned
toward him involuntarily. It was all part of the dream, and it was no
longer hers to question anything. It was the great dare. He was right.
She could dare what she wanted, and she did want. He was helping her
into her jacket. She was thrusting the hat-pins through her hair. And
even as she realized it, she found herself walking beside him through
the opened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>door. The &ldquo;Flight of the Duchess&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Statue and the Bust,&rdquo; darted through her mind.
Then she remembered &ldquo;Waring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;What&rsquo;s become of
Waring?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;Land travel or sea-faring?&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;
he murmured back.</p>
<p>And to her this kindred sufficient note was a vindication of her
madness.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the building he raised his hand to call a taxi,
but was stopped by her touch on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo; she breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the Ferry. We&rsquo;ve just time to catch that Sacramento
train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t go this way,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I
&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t even a change of handkerchiefs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up his hand again before replying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can shop in Sacramento. We&rsquo;ll <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>get
married there and catch the night overland north. I&rsquo;ll arrange
everything by telegraph from the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the cab drew to the curb, she looked quickly about her at the
familiar street and the familiar throng, then, with almost a flurry of
alarm, into Glendon&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know a thing about you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know everything about each other,&rdquo; was his
answer.</p>
<p>She felt the support and urge of his arms, and lifted her foot to
the step. The next moment the door had closed, he was beside her, and
the cab was heading down Market Street. He passed his arm around her,
drew her close, and kissed her. When next she glimpsed his face she was
certain that it was dyed with a faint blush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &hellip; I&rsquo;ve heard there was an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>art
in kissing,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything
about it myself, but I&rsquo;ll learn. You see, you&rsquo;re the first
woman I ever kissed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href=

<h2 class="main">IX</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Where a jagged peak of rock thrust above the vast
virgin forest, reclined a man and a woman. Beneath them, on the edge of
the trees, were tethered two horses. Behind each saddle were a pair of
small saddle-bags. The trees were monotonously huge. Towering hundreds
of feet into the air, they ran from eight to ten and twelve feet in
diameter. Many were much larger. All morning they had toiled up the
divide through this unbroken forest, and this peak of rock had been the
first spot where they could get out of the forest in order to see the
forest.</p>
<p>Beneath them and away, far as they could see, lay range upon range
of haze-empurpled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>mountains. There was no end to these
ranges. They rose one behind another to the dim, distant skyline, where
they faded away with a vague promise of unending extension beyond.
There were no clearings in the forest; north, south, east, and west,
untouched, unbroken, it covered the land with its mighty growth.</p>
<p>They lay, feasting their eyes on the sight, her hand clasped in one
of his; for this was their honeymoon, and these were the redwoods of
Mendocino. Across from Shasta they had come, with horses and
saddle-bags, and down through the wilds of the coast counties, and they
had no plan except to continue until some other plan entered their
heads. They were roughly dressed, she in travel-stained khaki, he in
overalls and woolen shirt. The latter was open at the sunburned neck,
and in his hugeness he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>seemed a fit dweller among the
forest giants, while for her, as a dweller with him, there were no
signs of aught else but happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Big Man,&rdquo; she said, propping herself up on an
elbow to gaze at him, &ldquo;it is more wonderful than you promised.
And we are going through it together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s a lot of the rest of the world we&rsquo;ll
go through together,&rdquo; he answered, shifting his position so as to
get her hand in both of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not till we&rsquo;ve finished with this,&rdquo; she
urged. &ldquo;I seem never to grow tired of the big woods &hellip; and
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slid effortlessly into a sitting posture and gathered her into
his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you lover,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;And I had given
up hope of finding such a one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I never hoped at all. I must <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>just
have known all the time that I was going to find you. Glad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her answer was a soft pressure where her hand rested on his neck,
and for long minutes they looked out over the great woods and
dreamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember I told you how I ran away from the red-haired
school teacher? That was the first time I saw this country. I was on
foot, but forty or fifty miles a day was play for me. I was a regular
Indian. I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about you then. Game was pretty scarce
in the redwoods, but there was plenty of fine trout. That was when I
camped on these rocks. I didn&rsquo;t dream that some day I&rsquo;d be
back with you, YOU.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And be a champion of the ring, too,&rdquo; <span class="corr"
id="xd26e1309" title="Source: he">she</span> suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t think about that at all. Dad had always
told me I was going to be, and I took it for granted. You see,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>he was very wise. He was a great man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t see you leaving the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He was so careful in hiding its
crookedness from me, that I think he feared it. I&rsquo;ve told you
about the contract with Stubener. Dad put in that clause about
crookedness. The first crooked thing my manager did was to break the
contract.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you are going to fight this Tom Cannam. Is it worth
while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want me to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear lover, I want you to do whatever you want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she said, and to herself, her words still ringing in her ears,
she marveled that she, not least among the stubbornly independent of
the breed of Sangster, should utter them. Yet she knew they were true,
and she was glad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138"
name="pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be fun,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand all the gleeful
details.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t worked them out yet. You might help me. In
the first place I&rsquo;m going to double-cross Stubener and the
betting syndicate. It will be part of the joke. I am going to put
Cannam out in the first round. For the first time I shall be really
angry when I fight. Poor Tom Cannam, who&rsquo;s as crooked as the
rest, will be the chief sacrifice. You see, I intend to make a speech
in the ring. It&rsquo;s unusual, but it will be a success, for I am
going to tell the audience all the inside workings of the game.
It&rsquo;s a good game, too, but they&rsquo;re running it on business
principles, and that&rsquo;s what spoils it. But there, I&rsquo;m
giving the speech to you instead of at the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could be there to hear,&rdquo; she said.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span></p>
<p>He looked at her and debated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to have you. But it&rsquo;s sure to be a rough
time. There is no telling what may happen when I start my program. But
I&rsquo;ll come straight to you as soon as it&rsquo;s over. And it will
be the last appearance of Young Glendon in the ring, in any
ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear, you&rsquo;ve never made a speech in your
life,&rdquo; she objected. &ldquo;You might fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head positively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Irish,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;and what
Irishman was there who couldn&rsquo;t speak?&rdquo; He paused to laugh
merrily. &ldquo;Stubener thinks I&rsquo;m crazy. Says a man can&rsquo;t
train on matrimony. A lot he knows about matrimony, or me, or you, or
anything except real estate and fixed fights. But I&rsquo;ll show him
that night, and poor Tom, too. I really feel sorry for Tom.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear abysmal brute is going to behave most abysmally and
brutally, I fear,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>He laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to make a noble attempt at it. Positively my
last appearance, you know. And then it will be you, YOU. But if you
don&rsquo;t want that last appearance, say the word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I want it, Big Man. I want my Big Man for himself,
and to be himself he must be himself. If you want this, I want it for
you, and for myself, too. Suppose I said I wanted to go on the stage,
or to the South Seas or the North Pole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered slowly, almost solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;d say go ahead. Because you are you and must be
yourself and do whatever you want. I love you because you are
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;re both a silly pair of lovers,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>she said, when his embrace had relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it great!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>He stood up, measured the sun with his eye, and extended his hand
out over the big woods that covered the serried, purple ranges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to sleep out there somewhere. It&rsquo;s
thirty miles to the nearest camp.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Who, of all the sports present, will ever forget the
memorable night at the Golden Gate Arena, when Young Glendon put Tom
Cannam to sleep and an even greater one than Tom Cannam, kept the great
audience on the ragged edge of riot for an hour, caused the subsequent
graft investigation of the supervisors and the indictments of the
contractors and the building commissioners, and pretty generally
disrupted the whole fight game. It was a complete surprise. Not even
Stubener had the slightest apprehension of what was coming. It was true
that his man had been insubordinate after the Nat Powers affair, and
had run off and got <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143"
name="pb143">143</a>]</span>married; but all that was over. Young Pat
had done the expected, swallowed the inevitable crookedness of the
ring, and come back into it again.</p>
<p>The Golden Gate Arena was new. This was its first fight, and it was
the biggest building of the kind San Francisco had ever erected. It
seated twenty-five thousand, and every seat was occupied. Sports had
traveled from all the world to be present, and they had paid fifty
dollars for their ring-side seats. The cheapest seat in the house had
sold for five dollars.</p>
<p>The old familiar roar of applause went up when Billy Morgan, the
veteran announcer, climbed through the ropes and bared his gray head.
As he opened his mouth to speak, a heavy crash came from a near section
where several tiers of low seats had collapsed. The crowd broke into
loud laughter and shouted jocular regrets <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>and advice to the
victims, none of whom had been hurt. The crash of the seats and the
hilarious uproar caused the captain of police in charge to look at one
of his lieutenants and lift his brows in token that they would have
their hands full and a lively night.</p>
<p>One by one, welcomed by uproarious applause, seven doughty old ring
heroes climbed through the ropes to be introduced. They were all
ex-heavy-weight champions of the world. Billy Morgan accompanied each
presentation to the audience with an appropriate phrase. One was hailed
as &ldquo;Honest John&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Reliable,&rdquo; another
was &ldquo;the squarest two-fisted fighter the ring ever saw.&rdquo;
And of others: &ldquo;the hero of a hundred battles and never threw one
and never lay down&rdquo;; &ldquo;the gamest of the old guard&rdquo;;
&ldquo;the only one who ever came back&rdquo;; &ldquo;the greatest
warrior of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>them all&rdquo;; and &ldquo;the hardest nut in
the ring to crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this took time. A speech was insisted on from each of them, and
they mumbled and muttered in reply with proud blushes and awkward
shamblings. The longest speech was from &ldquo;Old Reliable&rdquo; and
lasted nearly a minute. Then they had to be photographed. The ring
filled up with celebrities, with champion wrestlers, famous
conditioners, and veteran time-keepers and referees. Light-weights and
middle-weights swarmed. Everybody seemed to be challenging everybody.
Nat Powers was there, demanding a return match from Young Glendon, and
so were all the other shining lights whom Glendon had snuffed out.
Also, they all challenged Jim Hanford, who, in turn, had to make his
statement, which was to the effect that he would accord the next fight
to the winner <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>of the one that was about to take place. The
audience immediately proceeded to name the winner, half of it wildly
crying &ldquo;Glendon,&rdquo; and the other half &ldquo;Powers.&rdquo;
In the midst of the pandemonium another tier of seats went down, and
half a dozen rows were on between cheated ticket holders and the
stewards who had been reaping a fat harvest. The captain despatched a
message to headquarters for additional police details.</p>
<p>The crowd was feeling good. When Cannam and Glendon made their ring
entrances the Arena resembled a national political convention. Each was
cheered for a solid five minutes. The ring was now cleared. Glendon sat
in his corner surrounded by his seconds. As usual, Stubener was at his
back. Cannam was introduced first, and after he had scraped and ducked
his head, he was compelled to respond to the cries for a speech. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>stammered and halted, but managed to grind out
several ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to be here to-night,&rdquo; he said, and
found space to capture another thought while the applause was
thundering. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fought square. I&rsquo;ve fought square
all my life. Nobody can deny that. And I&rsquo;m going to do my best
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were loud cries of: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Tom!&rdquo;
&ldquo;We know that!&rdquo; &ldquo;Good boy, Tom!&rdquo;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the boy to fetch the bacon home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came Glendon&rsquo;s turn. From him, likewise, a speech was
demanded, though for principals to give speeches was an unprecedented
thing in the prize-ring. Billy Morgan held up his hand for silence, and
in a clear, powerful voice Glendon began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody has told you they were proud to be here
to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148"
href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>am not&rdquo; The audience
was startled, and he paused long enough to let it sink home, &ldquo;I
am not proud of my company. You wanted a speech. I&rsquo;ll give you a
real one. This is my last fight. After to-night I leave the ring for
good. Why? I have already told you. I don&rsquo;t like my company. The
prize-ring is so crooked that no man engaged in it can hide behind a
corkscrew. It is rotten to the core, from the little professional clubs
right up to this affair to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The low rumble of astonishment that had been rising at this point
burst into a roar. There were loud boos and hisses, and many began
crying: &ldquo;Go on with the fight!&rdquo; &ldquo;We want the
fight!&rdquo; &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you fight?&rdquo; Glendon,
waiting, noted that the principal disturbers near the ring were
promoters and managers and fighters. In vain did he strive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>to
make himself heard. The audience was divided, half crying out,
&ldquo;Fight!&rdquo; and the other half, &ldquo;Speech!
Speech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes of <span class="corr" id="xd26e1418" title=
"Source: hopeles">hopeless</span> madness prevailed. Stubener, the
referee, the owner of the Arena, and the promoter of the fight, pleaded
with Glendon to go on with the fight. When he refused, the referee
declared that he would award the fight in forfeit to Cannam if Glendon
did not fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it,&rdquo; the latter retorted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sue you in all the courts if you try that on, and
I&rsquo;ll not promise you that you&rsquo;ll survive this crowd if you
cheat it out of the fight. Besides, I&rsquo;m going to fight. But
before I do I&rsquo;m going to finish my speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s against the rules,&rdquo; protested the
referee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing of the sort. There&rsquo;s not a word in
the rules against ring-side <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href=
"#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>speeches. Every big fighter here
to-night has made a speech.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few words,&rdquo; shouted the promoter in
Glendon&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re giving a
lecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in the rules against lectures,&rdquo;
Glendon answered. &ldquo;And now you fellows get out of the ring or
I&rsquo;ll throw you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The promoter, apoplectic and struggling, was dropped over the ropes
by his coat-collar. He was a large man, but so easily had Glendon done
it with one hand that the audience went wild with delight. The cries
for a speech increased in volume. Stubener and the owner beat a wise
retreat. Glendon held up his hands to be heard, whereupon those that
shouted for the fight redoubled their efforts. Two or three tiers of
seats crashed down, and numbers who had thus lost their places, added
to the turmoil <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>by making a concerted rush to squeeze in on the
still intact seats, while those behind, blocked from sight of the ring,
yelled and raved for them to sit down.</p>
<p>Glendon walked to the ropes and spoke to the police captain. He was
compelled to bend over and shout in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t give this speech,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;this crowd will wreck the place. If they break <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1441" title="Source: lose">loose</span> you can never
hold them, you know that. Now you&rsquo;ve got to help. You keep the
ring clear and I&rsquo;ll silence the crowd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to the center of the ring and again held up his
hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want that speech?&rdquo; he shouted in a tremendous
voice.</p>
<p>Hundreds near the ring heard him and cried &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let every man who wants to hear shut up the noise-maker
next to him!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span></p>
<p>The advice was taken, so that when he repeated it, his voice
penetrated farther. Again and again he shouted it, and slowly, zone by
zone, the silence pressed outward from the ring, accompanied by a
muffled undertone of smacks and thuds and scuffles as the obstreperous
were subdued by their neighbors. Almost had all confusion been
smothered, when a tier of seats near the ring went down. This was
greeted with fresh roars of laughter, which of itself died away, so
that a lone voice, far back, was heard distinctly as it piped:
&ldquo;Go on, Glendon! We&rsquo;re with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon had the Celt&rsquo;s intuitive knowledge of the psychology
of the crowd. He knew that what had been a vast disorderly mob five
minutes before was now tightly in hand, and for added effect he
deliberately delayed. Yet the delay was just long enough and not a
second too long. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153"
name="pb153">153</a>]</span>For thirty seconds the silence was
complete, and the effect produced was one of awe. Then, just as the
first faint hints of restlessness came to his ears, he began to
speak:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I finish this speech,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going
to fight. I promise you it will be a real fight, one of the few real
fights you have ever seen. I am going to get my man in the shortest
possible time. Billy Morgan, in making his final announcement, will
tell you that it is to be a forty-five-round contest. Let me tell you
that it will be nearer forty-five seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was interrupted I was telling you that the ring was
rotten. It is&mdash;from top to bottom. It is run on business
principles, and you all know what business principles are. Enough said.
You are the suckers, every last one of you that is not making anything
out of it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>Why are the seats falling down to-night? Graft.
Like the fight game, they were built on business principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He now held the audience stronger than ever, and knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three men squeezed on two seats. I can see that
everywhere. What does it mean? Graft. The stewards don&rsquo;t get any
wages. They are supposed to graft. Business principles again. You pay.
Of course you pay. How are the fight permits obtained? Graft. And now
let me ask you: if the men who build the seats graft, if the stewards
graft, if the authorities graft, why shouldn&rsquo;t those higher up in
the fight game graft? They do. And you pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let me tell you it is not the fault of the fighters. They
don&rsquo;t run the game. The promoters and managers run it;
they&rsquo;re the business men. The fighters are only fighters. They
begin <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>honestly enough, but the managers and promoters
make them give in or kick them out. There have been straight fighters.
And there are now a few, but they don&rsquo;t earn much as a rule. I
guess there have been straight managers. Mine is about the best of the
boiling. But just ask him how much he&rsquo;s got salted down in real
estate and apartment houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the uproar began to drown his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let every man who wants to hear shut up the man alongside of
him!&rdquo; Glendon instructed.</p>
<p>Again, like the murmur of a surf, there was a rustling of smacks,
and thuds, and scuffles, and the house quieted down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does every fighter work overtime insisting that
he&rsquo;s always fought square? Why are they called Honest Johns, and
Honest Bills, and Honest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>Blacksmiths, and all the rest?
Doesn&rsquo;t it ever strike you that they seem to be afraid of
something? When a man comes to you shouting he is honest, you get
suspicious. But when a prize-fighter passes the same dope out to you,
you swallow it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the best man win! How often have you heard Billy Morgan
say that! Let me tell you that the best man doesn&rsquo;t win so often,
and when he does it&rsquo;s usually arranged for him. Most of the
grudge fights you&rsquo;ve heard or seen were arranged, too. It&rsquo;s
a program. The whole thing is programmed. Do you think the promoters
and managers are in it for their health? They&rsquo;re not.
They&rsquo;re business men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom, Dick, and Harry are three fighters. Dick is the best
man. In two fights he could prove it. But what happens? Tom licks
Harry. Dick licks <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157"
name="pb157">157</a>]</span>Tom. Harry licks Dick. Nothing proved. Then
come the return matches. Harry licks Tom. Tom licks Dick. Dick licks
Harry. Nothing proved. Then they try again. Dick is kicking. Says he
wants to get along in the game. So Dick licks Tom, and Dick licks
Harry. Eight fights to prove Dick the best man, when two could have
done it. All arranged. A regular program. And you pay for it, and when
your seats don&rsquo;t break down you get robbed of them by the
stewards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good game, too, if it were only square. The
fighters would be square if they had a chance. But the graft is too
big. When a handful of men can divide up three-quarters of a million
dollars on three fights&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wild outburst compelled him to stop. Out of the medley of cries
from all over the house, he could distinguish such as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>&ldquo;What million dollars?&rdquo; &ldquo;What
three fights?&rdquo; &ldquo;Tell us!&rdquo; &ldquo;Go on!&rdquo;
Likewise there were boos and hisses, and cries of &ldquo;Muckraker!
Muckraker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to hear?&rdquo; Glendon shouted. &ldquo;Then keep
order!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he compelled the impressive half minute of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is Jim Hanford planning? What is the program his crowd
and mine are framing up? They know I&rsquo;ve got him. He knows
I&rsquo;ve got him. I can whip him in one fight. But he&rsquo;s the
champion of the world. If I don&rsquo;t give in to the program,
they&rsquo;ll never give me a chance to fight him. The program calls
for three fights. I am to win the first fight. It will be pulled off in
Nevada if San Francisco won&rsquo;t stand for it. We are to make it a
good fight. To make it good, each of us will put up a side bet of
twenty thousand. It will be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>real money, but it won&rsquo;t be
a real bet. Each gets his own slipped back to him. The same way with
the purse. We&rsquo;ll divide it evenly, though the public division
will be thirty-five and sixty-five. The purse, the moving picture
royalties, the advertisements, and all the rest of the drags
won&rsquo;t be a cent less than two hundred and fifty thousand.
We&rsquo;ll divide it, and go to work on the return match. Hanford will
win that, and we divide again. Then comes the third fight; I win as I
have every right to; and we have taken three-quarters of a million out
of the pockets of the fighting public. That&rsquo;s the program, but
the money is dirty. And that&rsquo;s why I am quitting the ring
to-night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Jim Hanford, kicking a clinging policeman
back among the seat-holders, heaved his huge frame through the ropes,
bellowing: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed like an infuriated bull at Glendon, who sprang back, and
then, instead of meeting the rush, ducked cleanly away. Unable to check
himself, the big man fetched up against the ropes. Flung back by the
spring of them, he was turning to make another rush, when Glendon
landed him. Glendon, cool, clear-seeing, distanced his man perfectly to
the jaw and struck the first full-strength blow of his career. All his
strength, and his reserve of strength, went into that one smashing
muscular explosion.</p>
<p>Hanford was dead in the air&mdash;in so far as unconsciousness may
resemble death. So far as he was concerned, he ceased at the moment of
contact with Glendon&rsquo;s fist. His feet left the floor and he was
in the air until he struck the topmost rope. His inert body sprawled
across it, sagged at the middle, and fell through <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>the
ropes and down out of the ring upon the heads of the men in the press
seats.</p>
<p>The audience broke loose. It had already seen more than it had paid
to see, for the great Jim Hanford, the world champion, had been knocked
out. It was unofficial, but it had been with a single punch. Never had
there been such a night in fistiana. Glendon looked ruefully at his
damaged knuckles, cast a glance through the ropes to where Hanford was
groggily coming to, and held up his hands. He had clinched his right to
be heard, and the audience grew still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I began to fight,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they called me
&lsquo;One-Punch Glendon.&rsquo; You saw that punch a moment ago. I
always had that punch. I went after my men and got them on the jump,
though I was careful not to hit with all my might. Then I was educated.
My manager told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>me it wasn&rsquo;t fair to the crowd. He
advised me to make long fights so that the crowd could get a run for
its money. I was a fool, a mutt. I was a green lad from the mountains.
So help me God, I swallowed it as the truth. My manager used to talk
over with me what round I would put my man out in. Then he tipped it
off to the betting syndicate, and the betting syndicate went to it. Of
course you paid. But I am glad for one thing. I never touched a cent of
the money. They didn&rsquo;t dare offer it to me, because they knew it
would give the game away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember my fight with Nat Powers. I never knocked him
out. I had got suspicious. So the gang framed it up with him. I
didn&rsquo;t know. I intended to let him go a couple of rounds over the
sixteenth. That last punch in the sixteenth didn&rsquo;t shake him. But
he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>faked the knock-out just the same and fooled all
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about to-night?&rdquo; a voice called out. &ldquo;Is it a
frame-up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; was Glendon&rsquo;s answer. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
the syndicate betting? That Cannam will last to the
fourteenth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howls and hoots went up. For the last time Glendon held up his hand
for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost done now. But I want to tell you one thing.
The syndicate gets landed to-night. This is to be a square fight. Tom
Cannam won&rsquo;t last till the fourteenth round. He won&rsquo;t last
the first round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cannam sprang to his feet in his corner and cried out in a fury:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it. The man don&rsquo;t live who can get
me in one round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glendon ignored him and went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once now in my life I have struck <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>with
all my strength. You saw that a moment ago when I caught Hanford.
To-night, for the second time, I am going to hit with all my
strength&mdash;that is, if Cannam doesn&rsquo;t jump through the ropes
right now and get away. And now I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to his corner and held out his hands for his gloves. In the
opposite corner Cannam raged while his seconds tried vainly to calm
him. At last Billy Morgan managed to make the final announcement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a forty-five round contest,&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;Marquis of Queensbury Rules! And may the best man win! Let her
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gong struck. The two men advanced. Glendon&rsquo;s right hand
was extended for the customary shake, but Cannam, with an angry toss of
the head, refused to take it. To the general surprise, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>he
did not rush. Angry though he was, he fought carefully, his touched
pride impelling him to bend every effort to last out the round. Several
times he struck, but he struck cautiously, never relaxing his defense.
Glendon hunted him about the ring, ever advancing with the remorseless
tap-tap of his left foot. Yet he struck no blows, nor attempted to
strike. He even dropped his hands to his sides and hunted the other
defenselessly in an effort to draw him out. Cannam grinned defiantly,
but declined to take advantage of the proffered opening.</p>
<p>Two minutes passed, and then a change came over Glendon. By every
muscle, by every line of his face, he advertised that the moment had
come for him to get his man. Acting it was, and it was well acted. He
seemed to have become a thing of steel, as hard and pitiless as steel.
The effect was apparent on Cannam, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166"
href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>who redoubled his caution.
Glendon quickly worked him into a corner and herded and held him there.
Still he struck no blow, nor attempted to strike, and the suspense on
Cannam&rsquo;s part grew painful. In vain he tried to work out of the
corner, while he could not summon resolution to rush upon his opponent
in an attempt to gain the respite of a clinch.</p>
<p>Then it came&mdash;a swift series of simple feints that were muscle
flashes. Cannam was dazzled. So was the audience. No two of the
onlookers could agree afterward as to what took place. Cannam ducked
one feint and at the same time threw up his face guard to meet another
feint for his jaw. He also attempted to change position with his legs.
Ring-side witnesses swore that they saw Glendon start the blow from his
right hip and leap forward like a tiger to add the weight of his body
to it. Be that as it may, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>blow caught Cannam on the
point of the chin at the moment of his shift of position. And like
Hanford, he was unconscious in the air before he struck the ropes and
fell through on the heads of the reporters.</p>
<p>Of what happened afterward that night in the Golden Gate Arena,
columns in the newspapers were unable adequately to describe. The
police kept the ring clear, but they could not save the Arena. It was
not a riot. It was an orgy. Not a seat was left standing. All over the
great hall, by main strength, crowding and jostling to lay hands on
beams and boards, the crowd uprooted and over-turned. Prize-fighters
sought protection of the police, but there were not enough police to
escort them out, and fighters, managers, and promoters were beaten and
battered. Jim Hanford alone was spared. His jaw, prodigiously swollen,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>earned him this mercy. Outside, when finally
driven from the building, the crowd fell upon a new
seven-thousand-dollar motor car belonging to a well-known fight
promoter and reduced it to scrapiron and kindling wood.</p>
<p>Glendon, unable to dress amid the wreckage of dressing rooms, gained
his automobile, still in his ring costume and wrapped in a bath robe,
but failed to escape. By weight of numbers the crowd caught and held
his machine. The police were too busy to rescue him, and in the end a
compromise was effected, whereby the car was permitted to proceed at a
walk escorted by five thousand cheering madmen.</p>
<p>It was midnight when this storm swept past Union Square and down
upon the St. Francis. Cries for a speech went up, and though at the
hotel entrance, Glendon was good-naturedly restrained from escaping.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>He even tried leaping out upon the heads of the
enthusiasts, but his feet never touched the pavement. On heads and
shoulders, clutched at and uplifted by every hand that could touch his
body, he went back through the air to the machine. Then he gave his
speech, and Maud Glendon, looking down from an upper window at her
young Hercules towering on the seat of the automobile, knew, as she
always knew, that he meant it when he repeated that he had fought his
last fight and retired from the ring forever.</p>

<p>The sting of real appetite, the goodly ache of fatigue, the rush of
mad, strong blood that bites like wine through all one&rsquo;s body as
work is done, love and comradeship such as the world of civilization
seldom knows&mdash;all these are vividly portrayed in this splendid

<p>A woman good to look upon, if unlettered, of clean but sordid life,
set free from the pots and kettles of a Juneau kitchen by chance
reading of Thoreau&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cry of the Human&rdquo;&mdash;a woman
who finds her freedom and her joy queening a tribe of wild Indians and
several thousand square miles of Arctic hunting territory&mdash;this is
the heroine Jack London creates for the story which opens this
collection of short tales. Jack London is at his splendid best perhaps
when his people and his scenes are set in the far north; but here are
some of his more notable short stories, with widely varied settings and
character, but with a touch of &ldquo;the night-born&rdquo; wildness in

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
